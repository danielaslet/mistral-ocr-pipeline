# Protect yourself from summer pests

Summer is a time to relax, enjoy the outdoors, and spend more time with friends and family. But it's also the season when
bugs like mosquitoes, ticks, and bees are more active. These pests can carry diseases or cause allergic reactions, so it's
important to take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.


## These simple tips can help you stay safe:

### Use insect repellent

Choose a product with DEET, picaridin, or plant-
based lemon eucalyptus oil. Follow the directions on
the label and avoid getting it in your eyes or mouth.

Be aware of standing water
Mosquitoes breed in still water. Empty
flowerpots, birdbaths, and kiddie pools regularly.


### Wear protective clothing

Long sleeves, pants, and socks can help protect
you, especially in wooded or grassy areas.

Stay calm around bees

If a bee comes near you, don't swat at it.
Move away slowly.

Use citronella candles
They help repel mosquitoes and other bugs.


### Check for ticks

After spending time outdoors, check yourself,
your kids, and pets for ticks. Look behind ears,
under arms, and around the waist.

Keep food covered

When eating outside, cover food and drinks to
avoid attracting insects.
