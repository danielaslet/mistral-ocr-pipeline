# Critical Illness Limitations and Exclusions

Critical Illness benefits are not payable for a loss which is caused by a suicide or attempted suicide.

Covered Conditions must be separated by the period indicated in the Plan Design Summary to be eligible for benefits.
An insured cannot receive Critical Illness benefits for the same covered condition more than once, unless the
Recurrence Benefit is selected.

Employees may not be insured as both an employee and a spouse/dependent. If both parents are employees, only one
may elect the Critical Illness plan on dependent children.

If an Illness or Injury cause more than one Covered Condition to occur, benefits are payable under the Covered
Condition with the greatest benefit level percentage and would be payable once.

Critical Illness benefits are not payable for a Covered Condition if it results from: (a) the misuse of alcohol or taking of
drugs (other than under the direction of a Physician, who is neither the Employee, the Employee's family, or the
Employee's business associate); (b) Injury received during active participation in a riot, strike or civil commotion, or any
act incidental thereto; or (c) participation or attempt to participate in any illegal activity.
