## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This packet of notices related to our health care plan includes a notice
regarding how the plan's prescription drug coverage compares to
Medicare Part D. If you or a covered family member is also enrolled in
Medicare Parts A or B, but not Part D, you should read the Medicare
Part D notice carefully. It is titled, "Important Notice From WTI
Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies About Your Prescription
Drug Coverage and Medicare."

## MEDICARE PART D CREDITABLE COVERAGE NOTICE


## IMPORTANT NOTICE FROM WTI HOLDINGS LLC DBA WATERFIELD TECHNOLOGIES ABOUT YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE AND MEDICARE

Please read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about your current
prescription drug coverage with WTI Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies and about your options under
Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether you want to join a
Medicare drug plan. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug
coverage is at the end of this notice.

If neither you nor any of your covered dependents are eligible for or have Medicare, this notice does not apply to
you or your dependents, as the case may be. However, you should still keep a copy of this notice in the event you
or a dependent should qualify for coverage under Medicare in the future. Please note, however, that later notices
might supersede this notice.

1\. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You can get this
coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or
PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage
set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium.

2\. WTI Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by
the WTI Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies Employee Health Care Plan ("Plan") is, on average for all
plan participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is
considered "creditable" prescription drug coverage. This is important for the reasons described below.

Because your existing coverage is, on average, at least as good as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage,
you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare
drug plan, as long as you later enroll within specific time periods.


### Enrolling in Medicare-General Rules

As some background, you can join a Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare. If you
qualify for Medicare due to age, you may enroll in a Medicare drug plan during a seven-month initial enrollment
period. That period begins three months prior to your 65th birthday, includes the month you turn 65, and
continues for the ensuing three months. If you qualify for Medicare due to disability or end-stage renal disease,
your initial Medicare Part D enrollment period depends on the date your disability or treatment began. For more
information you should contact Medicare at the telephone number or web address listed below.


### Late Enrollment and the Late Enrollment Penalty

If you decide to wait to enroll in a Medicare drug plan you may enroll later, during Medicare Part D's annual
enrollment period, which runs each year from October 15 through December 7. But as a general rule, if you delay
your enrollment in Medicare Part D, after first becoming eligible to enroll, you may have to pay a higher
premium (a penalty).

If after your initial Medicare Part D enrollment period you go 63 continuous days or longer without
"creditable" prescription drug coverage (that is, prescription drug coverage that's at least as good as
Medicare's prescription drug coverage), your monthly Part D premium may go up by at least 1 percent of the
premium you would have paid had you enrolled timely, for every month that you did not have creditable
coverage.

For example, if after your Medicare Part D initial enrollment period you go 19 months without coverage, your
premium may be at least 19% higher than the premium you otherwise would have paid. You may have to pay this

<!-- PageBreak -->

higher premium for as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. However, there are some
important exceptions to the late enrollment penalty.


### Special Enrollment Period Exceptions to the Late Enrollment Penalty

There are "special enrollment periods" that allow you to add Medicare Part D coverage months or even years
after you first became eligible to do so, without a penalty. For example, if after your Medicare Part D initial
enrollment period you lose or decide to leave employer-sponsored or union-sponsored health coverage that
includes "creditable" prescription drug coverage, you will be eligible to join a Medicare drug plan at that time.

In addition, if you otherwise lose other creditable prescription drug coverage (such as under an individual policy)
through no fault of your own, you will be able to join a Medicare drug plan, again without penalty. These special
enrollment periods end two months after the month in which your other coverage ends.


### Compare Coverage

You should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered at what cost, with the coverage
and costs of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. See the WTI Holdings LLC
dba Waterfield Technologies Plan's summary plan description for a summary of the Plan's prescription drug
coverage. If you don't have a copy, you can get one by contacting us at the telephone number or address listed
below.


### Coordinating Other Coverage With Medicare Part D

Generally speaking, if you decide to join a Medicare drug plan while covered under the WTI Holdings LLC dba
Waterfield Technologies Plan due to your employment (or someone else's employment, such as a spouse or
parent), your coverage under the WTI Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies Plan will not be affected. For
most persons covered under the Plan, the Plan will pay prescription drug benefits first, and Medicare will
determine its payments second. For more information about this issue of what program pays first and what
program pays second, see the Plan's summary plan description or contact Medicare at the telephone number or
web address listed below.

If you do decide to join a Medicare drug plan and drop your WTI Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies
prescription drug coverage, be aware that you and your dependents may not be able to get this coverage back. To
regain coverage you would have to re-enroll in the Plan, pursuant to the Plan's eligibility and enrollment rules.
You should review the Plan's summary plan description to determine if and when you are allowed to add
coverage.


### For More Information About This Notice or Your Current Prescription Drug Coverage ...

Contact the person listed below for further information, or call 650.989.2688. NOTE: You'll get this notice each
year. You will also get it before the next period you can join a Medicare drug plan, and if this coverage through
WTI Holdings LLC dba Waterfield Technologies changes. You also may request a copy.


### For More Information About Your Options Under Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage ...

More detailed information about Medicare plans that offer prescription drug coverage is in the "Medicare &
You" handbook. You'll get a copy of the handbook in the mail every year from Medicare. You may also be
contacted directly by Medicare drug plans.

any other permitted purpose under the HIPAA regulations.

3\. Protected Health Information: The term "protected health information" includes all individually identifiable

group health plan.

· An example of a "treatment" activity includes consultation between the plan and your health care provider
regarding your coverage under the plan.

· Examples of "payment" activities include billing, claims management, and medical necessity reviews.

· Examples of "health care operations" include disease management and case management activities.

The group health plan may also disclose protected health information to a designated group of employees of the
Company, known as the HIPAA privacy team, for the purpose of carrying out plan administrative functions,
including treatment, payment and health care operations.

<!-- PageBreak -->

If protected health information is properly disclosed under the HIPAA Privacy Practices, such information may be
subject to redisclosure by the recipient and no longer protected under the HIPAA Privacy Practices.

5\. Disclosure for Underwriting Purposes. A group health plan is generally prohibited from using or disclosing
protected health information that is genetic information of an individual for purposes of underwriting.

6\. Uses and Disclosures Requiring Written Authorization: Subject to certain exceptions described elsewhere in

marketing purposes or sell your protected health information. Any use or disclosure not disclosed in this Notice
will be made only with your written authorization. If you authorize a disclosure of protected health information, it
will be disclosed solely for the purpose of your authorization and may be revoked at any time. Authorization forms
are available from the Privacy Official identified in section 23.

7\. Special Rule for Mental Health Information: Your written authorization generally will be obtained before a

programs established by law.

<!-- PageBreak -->

9\. Minimum Necessary Standard: When using or disclosing protected health information or when requesting
protected health information from another covered entity, a group health plan must make reasonable efforts not to
use, disclose or request more than the minimum amount of protected health information necessary to accomplish
the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request. The minimum necessary standard will not apply to:
disclosures to or requests by a health care provider for treatment; uses or disclosures made to the individual about
his or her own protected health information, as permitted or required by HIPAA; disclosures made to the
Department of Health and Human Services; or uses or disclosures that are required by law.

10\. Disclosures of Summary Health Information: A group health plan may use or disclose summary health
information to the Company for the purpose of obtaining premium bids or modifying, amending or terminating the
group health plan. Summary health information summarizes the participant claims history and other information
without identifying information specific to any one individual.

11\. Disclosures of Enrollment Information: A group health plan may disclose to the Company information on
whether an individual is enrolled in or has disenrolled in the plan.

12\. Disclosure to the Department of Health and Human Services: A group health plan may use and disclose your
protected health information to the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate or determine the group
health plan's compliance with the privacy regulations.

13\. Disclosures to Family Members, other Relations and Close Personal Friends: A group health plan may disclose
protected health information to your family members, other relatives, close personal friends and anyone else you
choose, if: (i) the information is directly relevant to the person's involvement with your care or payment for that
care, and (ii) either you have agreed to the disclosure, you have been given an opportunity to object and have not
objected, or it is reasonably inferred from the circumstances, based on the plan's common practice, that you would
not object to the disclosure.

For example, if you are married, the plan will share your protected health information with your spouse if he or she
reasonably demonstrates to the plan and its representatives that he or she is acting on your behalf and with your
consent. Your spouse might to do so by providing the plan with your claim number or social security number.
Similarly, the plan will normally share protected health information about a dependent child (whether or not
emancipated) with the child's parents. The plan might also disclose your protected health information to your
family members, other relatives, and close personal friends if you are unable to make health care decisions about
yourself due to incapacity or an emergency.

14\. Appointment of a Personal Representative: You may exercise your rights through a personal representative
upon appropriate proof of authority (including, for example, a notarized power of attorney). The group health plan
retains discretion to deny access to your protected health information to a personal representative.

15\. Individual Right to Request Restrictions on Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information: You may
request the group health plan to restrict (1) uses and disclosures of your protected health information to carry out
treatment, payment or health care operations, or (2) uses and disclosures to family members, relatives, friends or
other persons identified by you who are involved in your care or payment for your care. However, the group health
plan is not required to and normally will not agree to your request in the absence of special circumstances. A
covered entity (other than a group health plan) must agree to the request of an individual to restrict disclosure of
protected health information about the individual to the group health plan, if (a) the disclosure is for the purpose of
carrying out payment or health care operations and is not otherwise required by law, and (b) the protected health
information pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the individual (or person other the health plan
on behalf of the individual) has paid the covered entity in full.

16\. Individual Right to Request Alternative Communications: The group health plan will accommodate reasonable
written requests to receive communications of protected health information by alternative means or at alternative
locations (such as an alternative telephone number or mailing address) if you represent that disclosure otherwise
could endanger you. The plan will not normally accommodate a request to receive communications of protected

<!-- PageBreak -->

health information by alternative means or at alternative locations for reasons other than your endangerment unless
special circumstances warrant an exception.

17\. Individual Right to Inspect and Copy Protected Health Information: You have a right to inspect and obtain a
copy of your protected health information contained in a "designated record set," for as long as the group health
plan maintains the protected health information. A "designated record set" includes the medical records and billing
records about individuals maintained by or for a covered health care provider; enrollment, payment, billing, claims
adjudication and case or medical management record systems maintained by or for a health plan; or other
information used in whole or in part by or for the group health to make decisions about individuals.

The requested information will be provided within 30 days if the information is maintained on site or within 60
days if the information is maintained offsite. A single 30-day extension is allowed if the group health plan is unable
to comply with the deadline. If access is denied, you or your personal representative will be provided with a written
denial setting forth the basis for the denial, a description of how you may exercise those review rights and a
description of how you may contact the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

18\. Individual Right to Amend Protected Health Information: You have the right to request the group health plan
to amend your protected health information for as long as the protected health information is maintained in the
designated record set. The group health plan has 60 days after the request is made to act on the request. A single
30-day extension is allowed if the group health plan is unable to comply with the deadline. If the request is denied
in whole or part, the group health plan must provide you with a written denial that explains the basis for the denial.
You may then submit a written statement disagreeing with the denial and have that statement included with any
future disclosures of your protected health information.

19\. Right to Receive an Accounting of Protected Health Information Disclosures: You have the right to request
an accounting of all disclosures of your protected health information by the group health plan during the six years
prior to the date of your request. However, such accounting need not include disclosures made: (1) to carry out
treatment, payment or health care operations; (2) to individuals about their own protected health information;
(3) prior to the compliance date; or (4) pursuant to an individual's authorization.

If the accounting cannot be provided within 60 days, an additional 30 days is allowed if the individual is given a
written statement of the reasons for the delay and the date by which the accounting will be provided. If you request
more than one accounting within a 12-month period, the group health plan may charge a reasonable fee for each
subsequent accounting.

20\. Reproductive Health Care Privacy: Effective December 23, 2024, a group health plan may not disclose
protected health information to: (i) conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into a person for the
mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care; (ii) impose criminal, civil, or
administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive
health care; or (iii) identify any person for the purposes described in (i) and (ii).

Reproductive health care means care, services, or supplies related to the reproductive health of the individual.

This prohibition only applies if the reproductive health care is lawful under the law of the state in which the health
care was provided and under the circumstances in which it was provided, or if the reproductive health care was
protected, required, or authorized by Federal law, including the United States Constitution, regardless of the state
in which it is provided. For example, if you receive reproductive health care in a state where such care is lawful
even though it is not lawful in the state where you reside, the plan may not disclose this information to conduct an
investigation.

A group health plan may not use or disclose protected health information potentially related to reproductive health
care for the purposes of uses and disclosures of 1) public health oversight activities, 2) judicial and administrative
proceedings, 3) law enforcement purposes, and 4) coroners and medical examiners without obtaining a valid
attestation from the person requesting the use or disclosure of such information. A valid attestation under this
section must include the following elements:

<!-- PageBreak -->

(i) A description of the information requested that identifies the information in a specific fashion, including
one of the following: (A) the name of any individual(s) whose protected health information is sought, if practicable;
and (B) if including the name(s) of any individual(s) whose protected health information is sought is not practicable,
a description of the class of individuals whose protected health information is sought.

(ii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, who are requested to
make the use or disclosure.

(iii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered
entity is to make the requested use or disclosure.

(iv) A clear statement that the use or disclosure is not for a purpose prohibited by the reproductive health
care regulation.

(v) A statement that a person may be subject to criminal penalties if that person knowingly and in violation
of HIPAA obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual or discloses individually
identifiable health information to another person.

(vi) Signature of the person requesting the protected health information, which may be an electronic
signature, and date. If the attestation is signed by a representative of the person requesting the information, a
description of such representative's authority to act for the person must also be provided.

For example, if you lawfully obtain an abortion and an investigation into the provider is conducted, law enforcement
would need to submit an attestation in order to try and obtain the information. The plan would deny the request per
HIPAA's prohibition on the disclosure of reproductive health care because such care was lawful.

21\. The Right to Receive a Paper Copy of This Notice Upon Request: If you are receiving this Notice in an
electronic format, then you have the right to receive a written copy of this Notice free of charge by contacting the
Privacy Official (see section 24).

22\. Changes in the Privacy Practice. Each group health plan reserves the right to change its privacy practices from
time to time by action of the Privacy Official. You will be provided with an advance notice of any material change
in the plan's privacy practices.

23\. Your Right to File a Complaint with the Group Health Plan or the Department of Health and Human Services:
If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, you may complain to the group health plan in care of the
HIPAA Privacy Official (see section 24). You may also file a complaint with the Secretary of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, Hubert H. Humphrey Building, 200 Independence Avenue S. W., Washington, D.C.
20201\. The group health plan will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint.

24\. Person to Contact at the Group Health Plan for More Information: If you have any questions regarding this
Notice or the subjects addressed in it, you may contact the Privacy Official.

## NOTICE OF SPECIAL ENROLLMENT RIGHTS


### WTI HOLDINGS LLC DBA WATERFIELD TECHNOLOGIES EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE PLAN

If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health
insurance or group health plan coverage, you may be able to later enroll yourself and your dependents in this plan
if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing toward
your or your dependents' other coverage).

Loss of eligibility includes but is not limited to:

· Loss of eligibility for coverage as a result of ceasing to meet the plan's eligibility requirements (e.g., divorce,
cessation of dependent status, death of an employee, termination of employment, reduction in the number of
hours of employment);

· Loss of HMO coverage because the person no longer resides or works in the HMO service area and no other
coverage option is available through the HMO plan sponsor;

· Elimination of the coverage option a person was enrolled in, and another option is not offered in its place;

## GENERAL COBRA NOTICE


### Introduction

You're getting this notice because you recently gained coverage under a group health plan (the Plan). This notice
has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of
coverage under the Plan. This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become
available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it. When you become
eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA
continuation coverage.

The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other
members of your family when group health coverage would otherwise end. For more information about your
rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan
Description or contact the Plan Administrator.

You may have other options available to you when you lose group health coverage. For example, you may
be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through
the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs.
Additionally, you may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you
are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if that plan generally doesn't accept late enrollees.


### What is COBRA continuation coverage?

COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life
event. This is also called a "qualifying event." Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a
qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a "qualified beneficiary."
You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is
lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation
coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage.

If you're an employee, you'll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of
the following qualifying events:

· Your hours of employment are reduced, or

· Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.

If you're the spouse of an employee, you'll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the
Plan because of the following qualifying events:

· Your spouse dies;

· Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced;

· Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;

· Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or

. You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.

Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the
following qualifying events:

· The parent-employee dies;

· The parent-employee's hours of employment are reduced;

· The parent-employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;

· The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both);

· The parents become divorced or legally separated; or

· The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a "dependent child."

<!-- PageBreak -->

When is COBRA continuation coverage available?

The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator
has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the
following qualifying events:

· The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment;

· Death of the employee;

· The employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both).

For all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent
child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within
60 days after the qualifying event occurs. You must provide this notice in writing to the Plan
Administrator. Any notice you provide must state the name of the plan or plans under which you lost or
are losing coverage, the name and address of the employee covered under the plan, the name(s) and
address(es) of the qualified beneficiary(ies), and the qualifying event and the date it happened. The Plan
Administrator will direct you to provide the appropriate documentation to show proof of the event.

How is COBRA continuation coverage provided?

Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage
will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to
elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of
their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children.
COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to
employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event
during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage.

There are also ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended:
Disability extension of 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage

If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you
notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an
additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months. The disability would
have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least
until the end of the 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage. If you believe you are eligible for this
extension, contact the Plan Administrator.

Second qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage
If your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the
spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation
coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event. This
extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if
the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both);
gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent
child. This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent
child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.


### Are there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage?

Yes. Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and
your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a
"special enrollment period." Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can
learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.

### Can I enroll in Medicare instead of COBRA continuation coverage after my group health plan coverage ends?

In general, if you don't enroll in Medicare Part A or B when you are first eligible because you are still employed,
after the Medicare initial enrollment period, you have an 8-month special enrollment period1 to sign up for
Medicare Part A or B, beginning on the earlier of

· The month after your employment ends; or

· The month after group health plan coverage based on current employment ends.

If you don't enroll in Medicare and elect COBRA continuation coverage instead, you may have to pay a Part B
late enrollment penalty and you may have a gap in coverage if you decide you want Part B later. If you elect
COBRA continuation coverage and later enroll in Medicare Part A or B before the COBRA continuation
coverage ends, the Plan may terminate your continuation coverage. However, if Medicare Part A or B is
effective on or before the date of the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued on account of
Medicare entitlement, even if you enroll in the other part of Medicare after the date of the election of COBRA
coverage.

If you are enrolled in both COBRA continuation coverage and Medicare, Medicare will generally pay first
(primary payer) and COBRA continuation coverage will pay second. Certain plans may pay as if secondary to
Medicare, even if you are not enrolled in Medicare.
