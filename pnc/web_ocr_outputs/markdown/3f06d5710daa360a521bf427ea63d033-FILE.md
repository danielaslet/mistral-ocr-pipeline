# Premium Assistance Under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)

If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you're eligible for health coverage from your employer,
your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or
CHIP programs. If you or your children aren't eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you won't be eligible for these premium
assistance programs but you may be able to buy individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.
For more information, visit www.healthcare.gov.

If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed below, contact your
State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available.

If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents
might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or
www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you
pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan.

If you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your
employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you aren't already enrolled. This is
called a "special enrollment" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible
for premium assistance. If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor
at www.askebsa.dol.gov or call 1-866-444-EBSA (3272).

If you live in one of the following states, you may be eligible for assistance paying your employer health plan
premiums. The following list of states is current as of March 17, 2025. Contact your State for more information
on eligibility -
