# IMPORTANT: This is a fixed indemnity policy, NOT health insurance

This fixed indemnity policy may pay you a limited dollar amount if you're sick
or hospitalized. You're still responsible for paying the cost of your care.

. The payment you get isn't based on the size of your medical bill.

. There might be a limit on how much this policy will pay each year.

. This policy isn't a substitute for comprehensive health insurance.

. Since this policy isn't health insurance, it doesn't have to include most
Federal consumer protections that apply to health insurance.

Looking for comprehensive health insurance?

. Visit HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 (TTY:1-855-889-4325) to
find health coverage options.

. To find out if you can get health insurance through your job, or a
family member's job, contact the employer.


## Questions about this policy?

. For questions or complaints about this policy contact your State

. Department of Insurance. Find their number on the National
Association of Insurance Commissioner's website (NAIC.org) under
"Insurance Departments."

. If you have this policy through your job, or a family member's job,
contact the employer.

you are confined in a hospital. The extra money is paid directly to you and can help cover medical bills, deductibles, the increased
