Summer is a great time to get outside, travel, and try new adventures. But with all the fun, there's also a chance of scrapes,
bug bites, sunburns, and other minor injuries. That's why it's smart to have a first aid kit ready whether you're heading to the
beach, going on a hike, or just spending time in the backyard.


## How to build your first aid kit


### Start with the basics

Include bandages in different sizes, gauze pads,
adhesive tape, antiseptic wipes, and antibiotic
ointment to treat cuts and scrapes.

Be ready for stings and allergies
If someone has a known allergy, make sure you
have their epinephrine auto-injector (like an
EpiPen) and know how to use it.

### Add items for common summer needs

Pack tweezers for splinters or ticks, aloe vera for
sunburn, hydrocortisone cream for itchy bites,
and an ice pack to reduce swelling.


### Include a thermometer and gloves

These tools help with checking temperatures
and protecting yourself when giving care.

(

Don't forget medications
Include pain relievers like ibuprofen or
acetaminophen, allergy medicine like
antihistamines, and any personal medications
your family may need.

Check your kit often

Replace anything that's expired, and make sure
everything is clean and ready to use.

One first aid kit
is good, but two
are better!

A well-stocked first aid kit can help you take quick
action. To be prepared no matter where you are,
keep one in your home and another in your car.
