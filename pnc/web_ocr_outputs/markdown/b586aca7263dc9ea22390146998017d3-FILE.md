# Everyday habits to keep your brain sharp

No matter your age, your brain needs care-just like the rest of your body. By building a few simple habits into your daily
routine, you can help boost your brainpower and keep your mind strong and focused. Try these everyday ways to support
your brain health.


## Simple ways to boost your brainpower


### Move your body

Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain,
which helps with memory and learning. Even taking
a short daily walk can make a big difference.


### Stay social

Spending time with friends or loved ones can help
you feel happier and sharper. Social activity has
been linked to better brain health.


### Get good sleep

Aim for 7 to 9 hours each night. Sleep helps your
brain rest so you can think clearly the next day.


### Try something new

Learning a new skill, hobby, or language builds
new brain connections. It's also fun and rewarding.


### Eat brain-friendly foods

Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
and fish. These foods give your brain the nutrients
it needs to stay healthy.

### Limit distractions

Turn off notifications or set a timer to focus
on one task. Giving your brain a break from
multitasking helps you think more clearly.

### Take time to relax

Stress can hurt your brain's ability to focus.
Reduce stress by trying deep breathing,
stretching, or taking a quiet moment
to recharge.


### Make progress with small changes

You don't need to make big changes overnight.
Start small and pick one or two habits to try.
