How vision insurance can help
you see clearly as you get older.


# Vision insurance

Vision insurance helps protect the
health of your eyes by providing coverage
for benefits that often aren't covered
by regular medical insurance.

Protecting your eyesight means allowing for routine visits
to the optometrist for eye exams, as well as coverage for
glasses and contacts. Make sure your eyes remain in great
shape at any age - no matter how much time you spend
staring at digital screens.


## Who is it for?

Even if you have perfect eyesight, it's important to have regular eye exams
to make sure you're still seeing clearly. Most of us may eventually need
vision correction, which is why we offer vision insurance to cover some of
the costs.


## What does it cover?

Vision insurance covers benefits not typically included in medical insurance
plans. It covers things like routine eye exams, allowances towards the
purchase of eyeglasses and contact lenses, as well as discounts on
corrective Lasik surgery.


## Why should I consider it?

Regular eye exams can detect more than failing eyesight, they can also pick
up diseases like glaucoma and diabetes. Vision problems are one of the
most prevalent disabilities in the United States, making vision insurance
especially useful for anyone who regularly needs to purchase eyeglasses or
contacts, or anyone who simply wants to help protect their eyesight and
general health.

You will receive these benefits if you meet the conditions listed in the policy.

20/20 coverage

David notices that his vision is
deteriorating. He goes in for an eye
exam, and is diagnosed with myopia,
which means he needs glasses.

Average cost of vision exam: $171

Average cost of frames and
lenses: $350

Total cost: $521

With a Vision policy from Guardian,
David pays just $10 for his eye exam.
After $25 in copay, his lenses are fully
covered, and he pays $96 for his
frames.

David's total out-of-pocket expense
is $131, saving him $390.
