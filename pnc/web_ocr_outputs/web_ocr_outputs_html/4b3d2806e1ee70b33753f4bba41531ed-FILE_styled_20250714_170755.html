<h1>Be ready for anything with a first aid kit</h1>

<p>Summer is a great time to get outside, travel, and try new adventures. But with all the fun, there&rsquo;s also a chance of scrapes,
bug bites, sunburns, and other minor injuries. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s smart to have a first aid kit ready whether you&rsquo;re heading to the
beach, going on a hike, or just spending time in the backyard.</p>
<h2>How to build your first aid kit</h2>
<h3>Start with the basics</h3>
<p>Include bandages in different sizes, gauze pads,
adhesive tape, antiseptic wipes, and antibiotic
ointment to treat cuts and scrapes.</p>
<p>Be ready for stings and allergies
If someone has a known allergy, make sure you
have their epinephrine auto-injector (like an
EpiPen) and know how to use it.</p>
<p>+</p>
<h3>Add items for common summer needs</h3>
<p>Pack tweezers for splinters or ticks, aloe vera for
sunburn, hydrocortisone cream for itchy bites,
and an ice pack to reduce swelling.</p>
<h3>Include a thermometer and gloves</h3>
<p>These tools help with checking temperatures
and protecting yourself when giving care.</p>
<p>(</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget medications
Include pain relievers like ibuprofen or
acetaminophen, allergy medicine like
antihistamines, and any personal medications
your family may need.</p>
<p>Check your kit often</p>
<p>Replace anything that&rsquo;s expired, and make sure
everything is clean and ready to use.</p>

<p>One first aid kit
is good, but two
are better!</p>
<p>A well-stocked first aid kit can help you take quick
action. To be prepared no matter where you are,
keep one in your home and another in your car.</p>
