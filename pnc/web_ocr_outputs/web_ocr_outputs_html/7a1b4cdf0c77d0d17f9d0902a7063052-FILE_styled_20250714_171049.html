<p>Did you know 60% of patients have to wait 2 weeks to see
their primary physician and only 10% are able to get in to
see their regular doctor the same day they need care?1</p>
<p>Our Teladoc Health benefit gives you access to
compassionate care from U.S. board certified clinicians,
anytime, anywhere. Providers are available in all 50 states
and you can meet with them 24/7 by phone or video.</p>
<p>The average Emergency Room care costs 10 times more
than an urgent care visit for the same diagnosis.2</p>
<p>Teladoc Health can help you skip the trip to the ER or urgent
care for non-emergency problems, avoid long wait times and
save money since you can see a clinician within minutes by
phone or video. Teladoc Health is here to listen, answer your
questions and help you feel better faster.</p>

and can help you with everyday, non-emergency health needs like prescription refills, coughs, colds,
UTIs, sinus, allergies and much more. Teladoc Health helps you get healthy and live healthy.</p>
<p>. How much does Teladoc Health cost? Your out of pocket cost varies based on your plan. If you do
