activity. It even takes

freezes or lock, and work with you
to resolve your fraud incident.</p>
<h2>Q. How are my finances protected?</h2>

inquiries, like if someone tries to

<p>Q. What happens if one of my
password is compromise?</p>
<p>A. Aura will let you know if your
credentials have been found on the
Dark Web. The password manager
lets you change passwords with one
click for select sites.</p>
<p>Q. What is credit monitoring?</p>
<p>A. Credit monitoring helps detect
possible financial and identity fraud
by monitoring changes to your credit
report. This helps you stay on top of
your credit and protect your credit
score by receiving alerts if
suspicious activity is detected.</p>
<p>Q. Who can I protect with a
Family plan?</p>
<p>A: Account owners can add up to 10
adults to their plan, regardless of
age or address. Adult members will
have their own account and enjoy
the same benefits and their info is
kept private from other adults on the
plan.</p>
<p>Account owners may also add
unlimited minors (under 18) to their
plan, if they have parental
guardianship rights over the minor.
The minor&rsquo;s alerts will be available
for only the account owner to
review.</p>
<p>Q. What else do I get?</p>
<p>A. Every digital security plan comes
with $5 million identity theft
insurance1 and 24/7 U.S .- based
customer support.</p>
<p>Q. What is a VPN?</p>
<p>A. VPN (virtual private network)
protects your privacy online. It hides
your IP address so you can
browse the internet with confidence.
Turn on the VPN when you&rsquo;re
connected to public Wi-Fi networks,
like hotel or coffee shop Wi-Fi, in
order to keep your online activities
private and secure.</p>
