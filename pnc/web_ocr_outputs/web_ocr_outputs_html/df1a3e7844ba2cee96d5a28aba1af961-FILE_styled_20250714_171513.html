<h1>IMPORTANT: This is a fixed indemnity policy, NOT health insurance</h1>
<p>This fixed indemnity policy may pay you a limited dollar amount if you&rsquo;re sick
or hospitalized. You&rsquo;re still responsible for paying the cost of your care.</p>
<p>. The payment you get isn&rsquo;t based on the size of your medical bill.</p>
<p>. There might be a limit on how much this policy will pay each year.</p>
<p>. This policy isn&rsquo;t a substitute for comprehensive health insurance.</p>
<p>. Since this policy isn&rsquo;t health insurance, it doesn&rsquo;t have to include most
Federal consumer protections that apply to health insurance.</p>
<p>Looking for comprehensive health insurance?</p>
<p>. Visit HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 (TTY:1-855-889-4325) to
find health coverage options.</p>
<p>. To find out if you can get health insurance through your job, or a
family member&rsquo;s job, contact the employer.</p>
<h2>Questions about this policy?</h2>
<p>. For questions or complaints about this policy contact your State</p>
<p>. Department of Insurance. Find their number on the National
Association of Insurance Commissioner&rsquo;s website (NAIC.org) under
&ldquo;Insurance Departments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>. If you have this policy through your job, or a family member&rsquo;s job,
contact the employer.</p>

you are confined in a hospital. The extra money is paid directly to you and can help cover medical bills, deductibles, the increased
expenses, medical or otherwise, you face. The proceeds from your approved claim may be used however you wish.</p>
