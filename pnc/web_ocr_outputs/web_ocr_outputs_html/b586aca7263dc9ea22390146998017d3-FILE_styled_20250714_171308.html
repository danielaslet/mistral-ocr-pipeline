<h1>Everyday habits to keep your brain sharp</h1>
<p>No matter your age, your brain needs care-just like the rest of your body. By building a few simple habits into your daily
routine, you can help boost your brainpower and keep your mind strong and focused. Try these everyday ways to support
your brain health.</p>
<h2>Simple ways to boost your brainpower</h2>
<h3>Move your body</h3>
<p>Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain,
which helps with memory and learning. Even taking
a short daily walk can make a big difference.</p>
<h3>Stay social</h3>
<p>Spending time with friends or loved ones can help
you feel happier and sharper. Social activity has
been linked to better brain health.</p>
<h3>Get good sleep</h3>
<p>Aim for 7 to 9 hours each night. Sleep helps your
brain rest so you can think clearly the next day.</p>
<h3>Try something new</h3>
<p>Learning a new skill, hobby, or language builds
new brain connections. It&rsquo;s also fun and rewarding.</p>
<h3>Eat brain-friendly foods</h3>
<p>Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
and fish. These foods give your brain the nutrients
it needs to stay healthy.</p>
<p>x</p>
<h3>Limit distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off notifications or set a timer to focus
on one task. Giving your brain a break from
multitasking helps you think more clearly.</p>

<h3>Take time to relax</h3>
<p>Stress can hurt your brain&rsquo;s ability to focus.
Reduce stress by trying deep breathing,
stretching, or taking a quiet moment
to recharge.</p>
<h3>Make progress with small changes</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to make big changes overnight.
Start small and pick one or two habits to try.</p>
