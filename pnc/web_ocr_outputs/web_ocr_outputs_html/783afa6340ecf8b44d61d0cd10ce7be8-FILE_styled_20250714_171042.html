<h1>Protect yourself from summer pests</h1>
<p>Summer is a time to relax, enjoy the outdoors, and spend more time with friends and family. But it&rsquo;s also the season when
bugs like mosquitoes, ticks, and bees are more active. These pests can carry diseases or cause allergic reactions, so it&rsquo;s
important to take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<h2>These simple tips can help you stay safe:</h2>
<h3>ž5</h3>
<h3>Use insect repellent</h3>
<p>Choose a product with DEET, picaridin, or plant-
based lemon eucalyptus oil. Follow the directions on
the label and avoid getting it in your eyes or mouth.</p>
<p>Be aware of standing water
Mosquitoes breed in still water. Empty
flowerpots, birdbaths, and kiddie pools regularly.</p>
<h3>Wear protective clothing</h3>
<p>Long sleeves, pants, and socks can help protect
you, especially in wooded or grassy areas.</p>
<p>Stay calm around bees</p>
<p>If a bee comes near you, don&rsquo;t swat at it.
Move away slowly.</p>
<p>Use citronella candles
They help repel mosquitoes and other bugs.</p>
<h3>Check for ticks</h3>
<p>After spending time outdoors, check yourself,
your kids, and pets for ticks. Look behind ears,
under arms, and around the waist.</p>
<p>Keep food covered</p>
<p>When eating outside, cover food and drinks to
avoid attracting insects.</p>
