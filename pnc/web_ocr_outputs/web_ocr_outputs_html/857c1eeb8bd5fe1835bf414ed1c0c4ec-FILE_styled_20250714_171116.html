<h1>Important Transfer Information</h1>
<h2>Eligibility for HSA Transfer</h2>
<p>You may only transfer funds into a isolved Benefit Services HSA from an HSA, Archer MSA or IRA. You may only transfer funds if you are the
consumer of the transferring HSA, Archer MSA or IRA. If you are the surviving spouse of a deceased consumer, or the former spouse of the
consumer who is receiving an interest in the HSA, Archer MSA or IRA pursuant to a divorce or separation agreement, then contact isolved Benefit
Services for additional instructions.</p>
<p>One-Time Transfer from a Roth or Traditional IRA to an HSA</p>
<p>IRA transfers count toward and are limited to your maximum HSA contribution for the year. The amount of your IRA transfer is not allowed as a
deduction. Your funds will be returned in the event that the deposit amount, when added to your total cumulative year-to-date contribution, exceeds
the maximum annual contribution threshold as determined by the IRS. Generally, only one transfer may be made during the lifetime of an
individual. Penalties may apply if High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) coverage does not continue for 12 months. This transfer option does not
apply to SEP or SIMPLE IRAs.</p>
<p>Excess Contributions</p>
<p>You are not permitted to transfer excess contributions from an HSA, Archer MSA or IRA to a [isolved Benefit Services HSA. If any portion of your
transfer is or becomes an excess contribution, it is your responsibility to notify isolved Benefit Services and request a withdrawal of the excess
contribution together with any net income attributable thereto.</p>
<p>Investments</p>
<p>Your HSA will be invested as provided under your HSA arrangement with isolved Benefit Services.</p>
<p>Additional Information about HSAs</p>
<p>See IRS Publication 969 Health Savings Accounts and other Tax Favored Health Plans, for additional information about HSAs. This publication is
available free from the Internal Revenue Service and is available through the IRS Web site: www.irs.gov.</p>
<p>Direct Rollover</p>
<p>If you have already received a distribution from your HSA or IRA, you may be eligible to make a rollover into your isolved Benefit Services HSA
(instead of a transfer). Rollovers can be deposited into your isolved Benefit Services HSA via the HSA Contribution Form.</p>
