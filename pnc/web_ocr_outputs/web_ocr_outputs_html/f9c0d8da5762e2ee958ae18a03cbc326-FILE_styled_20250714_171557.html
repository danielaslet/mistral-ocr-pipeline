<h1>How to Make a Repayment</h1>
<p>Certain situations may require you to repay isolved Benefit Services for a paid claim that is either an ineligible expense
or missing documentation. This can be easily completed on the Online Portal.</p>
<p>If you have a denied claim that needs to be repaid and it is not repaid prior to the end of the plan year, your employer
can list those denied funds as taxable income on your W2.</p>
<h2>Steps to Make a Repayment</h2>
<p>A repayment of a claim is required once the paid claim is denied and marked for repayment. You will be able to repay
online.</p>
<p>1. Under Action Require, you will see an alert
about a repayment. Click on the link to begin
the process.</p>
