What to know before you enroll
------------------------------

If you wish to enroll in any health benefits in 2025 for yourself or your family, you must make your elections during our annual open enrollment. Plans elected and waived during an open enrollment period will remain in place for the entire plan (calendar) year unless you experience a qualifying life event as defined by the IRS.

If you wish to make changes to your benefit coverage as a result of a qualifying life event, the IRS requires that you make changes to your coverage within 30 days of your qualifying life event. You will need to provide proof of the event, such as a marriage certificate, divorce decree, birth certificate or loss-of-coverage letter.

Please remember to add your Social Security number and the Social Security numbers of your dependents during enrollment.

**IMPORTANT:** You must enroll in or waive each plan option.

Let's talk about eligibility for benefits
-----------------------------------------

You may enroll in the benefits program if you are a regular full-time employee who is actively working a minimum of 30 hours per week. As a benefits-eligible employee, you have the opportunity to enroll in benefit plans as a new hire or during the annual open enrollment period. As a new employee, your benefits will be effective the first day of the month following hire.

As you become eligible for benefits, so do your eligible dependents. In general, eligible dependents include:

* Your spouse which includes your legal spouse or domestic partner (same sex).
* Your children up to the age of 26. This includes your natural children and those of your spouse, adopted children, stepchildren, foster children, or children obtained through court-appointed legal guardianship. If your child is mentally or physically disabled, coverage may continue beyond age 26 once proof of the ongoing disability is provided to and approved by the People and Culture team. Additionally, children who have been named in a qualified medical child support order are covered by our plan.

What is a qualifying life event?
--------------------------------

It is your responsibility to notify human resources within 30 days of the qualifying life event. Failure to do so may result in an inability to change your benefit election(s).

**Here are some examples of qualifying life events:**

![](https://d36ps6jii4qpju.cloudfront.net/snapshots/2ff23b32bab5da002ac0d36fe1f5e95f-FULLARROW.jpg?v=1752268802)

* Birth, legal adoption or placement for adoption.

* Dependent child reaches age 26.
* Spouse or dependent loses or gains coverage elsewhere.
* Death of your spouse or dependent child.
* Court-ordered change.

Where do I go for the best care?
--------------------------------

Knowing where to go for medical care can save you lots of time and money! It can also help get you the best care for your situation. Here are some general guidelines to assist you in determining the best option for you.

#### DOCTOR'S OFFICE

![](https://d36ps6jii4qpju.cloudfront.net/files/443ffbde8141ff05a94223b9edfd94e5-IMAGE.jpg?z=29f2f9ce5fef4ef4b77b3c3dc18999a0)

When you have any medical concern, your primary doctor can oversee your care, provide routine services and refer you to specialists, if necessary.

* Routine checkups.
* Immunizations.
* Preventive services.
* Manage your overall health.

**LOWEST COST**

#### URGENT CARE

![](https://d36ps6jii4qpju.cloudfront.net/files/864dcf5effabd69857c69a0fbf6b62e1-IMAGE.jpg?z=b0af0934cd314b90aeefdd80bf8baff9)

When you need care quickly, your primary doctor is not available and your condition is not life-threatening, go to urgent care. Some examples include:

* Sprains/strains.
* Minor broken bones.
* Rash.
* Flu and fever (below 104°).
* Earache/sore throat.

**MEDIUM COST**

#### EMERGENCY ROOM

![](https://d36ps6jii4qpju.cloudfront.net/files/bc1b9aacb6df2960722e2e6caaf0fe4e-IMAGE.jpg?z=c7e05acc2c04455885ee5af37b65fa4b)

When you need immediate treatment of a serious or critical condition, go to the ER:

* Severe/life-threatening symptoms.
* Severe head injury.
* Excessive bleeding.
* Extreme pain.
* Shortness of breath.
* Broken bones.

**HIGHEST COST**

### **Learn about prescription drugs**

![Video](https://d36ps6jii4qpju.cloudfront.net/snapshots/5d68a39169a96db34b0c5134b57afae2-FULLARROW.jpg?v=1752268802)

**Traditional drugs**

* **Generic drugs offer the lowest copay:** You pay the lowest copay for generics, making these drugs the most cost-effective option for treatment.
* **Brand drugs are a higher copay:** This category includes preferred, brand name drugs that don't yet have a generic equivalent. These drugs are more expensive than generics, and a higher copay.
* **Non-preferred drugs are the highest copay:** In this category are nonpreferred brand name drugs for which there is either a generic alternative or a more cost-effective preferred brand. These drugs have the highest copay. Make sure to check for mail order discounts that may be available.

![Video](https://d36ps6jii4qpju.cloudfront.net/snapshots/1134caa3275e6acbfa91f8d8ff9acb0d-FULLARROW.jpg?v=1752268802)

**Specialty drugs**

* **Preferred drugs offer the lowest specialty drug copay:** Specialty drugs are generally more effective and less expensive than nonpreferred specialty drugs.
* **Non-preferred drugs are the highest specialty drug copay:** These drugs have the highest copay for specialty drugs, usually because there may be a more cost-effective generic or preferred brand available.

#### **Save money with generic preferred drugs. Ask your doctor if it’s appropriate to use a generic drug rather than a brand. Generic drugs are less expensive, and according to the FDA, they contain the same active ingredients as a brand name.**

**Helpful cost savings tips**

* **Mail order:** Many drugs are available in a 90-day supply, rather than the 30-day retail supply. The Mail order cost is 2.5x the preferred copay.
* **Good Rx:** You can save on prescription costs by utilizing online tools like [GoodRx.com](http://www.goodrx.com/ "Good RX") This platform provides an Rx database to help you find the most affordable pharmacy for your specific prescription. You may also find coupons directly from the drug manufacturers via their websites that may reduce your expenses. Keep in mind that some coupons can only be used outside of your prescription plan and will not count towards your annual out-of-pocket maximums.

**Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts**
=================================================

Provided through iSolved.
-------------------------

Health Savings Account (HSA)
----------------------------

An HSA is a personal healthcare bank account you can use to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses with pretax dollars. If you enroll in a high-deductible health plan, you can open an HSA.

You own and administer your HSA. You determine how much you contribute to your account, when to use your money to pay for qualified medical expenses, and when to reimburse yourself. Remember, this is a bank account; you must have money in the account before you can spend it.

IMPORTANT
---------

iSolved will be your new HSA administrator for 2025. If you current have an HSA open through Navia you have until January 31st to transfer your HSA funds to iSolved and close your account.  After this time you will be responsible for all admin fees and your account will be retailed to WellSaver.

To transfer funds from Navia to iSolved complete the below form and send it to **customerservice@naviabenefits.com.**  Note you will be charged a $25 account closure fee when closing your account with Navia.

[HSA Account Closure Form](https://flimp.live/WTHSATransferForm)

#### **You are eligible to open and fund an HSA if:**

* You are not enrolled in any other non-HSA qualified health insurance plan.\*
* You are not covered by your spouse’s health plan (unless it is a qualified HDHP), flexible spending account (FSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA).
* You are not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.
* You are not enrolled in Medicare, TRICARE or TRICARE For Life.
* Care received through the VA in the preceding three calendar months was dental, vision or preventive care or was provided to a veteran who has a disability rating from the VA.

\*You must not have any other first-dollar health insurance coverage before the deductible is met. Preventive care services are not required to be subject to the deductible. Individuals may also carry separate coverage for accidents, disability, dental or vision care, and long-term care, not subject to the deductible. Limited-purpose flexible spending accounts are allowed for vision and dental expenses.

#### **How to access/make contributions to your HSA**

Once your account is open, you can access it via iSolved portal/app. You’ll set up your payroll contributions during open enrollment, but you can make contribution changes at any time during the year through iSolved. Note that it may take between one and two payroll periods for an HSA change to be processed.

**Portal Information:**

**Mobile Resources:**

[iFlex App](https://flimp.live/7cdkpdcfs)

#### **IMPORTANT! How much you can deposit into an HSA in 2025?**

Waterfield Technologies employer contributions count toward the annual HSA contribution limits, so carefully plan how much you’ll contribute annually to avoid excess contributions. These limits apply even for participants entering the plan midyear.\* Prior-year contributions may be made through April 15 of the following year.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IRS limits subject to change** | **Under age 55** | **Age 55 and older (and not enrolled in Medicare)** |
| Individual | $4,300 | $5,300 (includes $1,000 “catch-up” contribution) |
| Family | $8,550 | $9,550 (includes $1,000 “catch-up” contribution) |

If you make the full-year contribution based upon your status as of Dec. 1, you may be subject to an IRS testing period and could owe tax and a penalty on part of that contribution if you do not remain an eligible individual through Dec. 31 of the following year. You may also need to prorate your contribution if you drop or reduce the level of your coverage midyear.

### More details about health savings accounts

The HSA is administered by iSolved. Waterfield Technologies pays the monthly administrative fee for your HSA. If your coverage status or employment status changes, you will be responsible for all HSA account holder fees.

You’ll notice two separate line items on your paycheck when you participate in the HDHP with HSA option — one for your employee contributions for the HDHP and one for your pretax contributions to the HSA.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Employer annual HSA contributions** | | |
|  | **$3,300 PPO QHDHP** | **$5,000 PPO QHDHP** |
| Employee | $250 | $300 |
| Employee + spouse | $500 | $700 |
| Employee + child(ren) | $500 | $700 |
| Family | $500 | $700 |

#### **HSAs offer you the following advantages:**

**Tax savings**

You contribute pretax dollars to the HSA. Waterfield Technologies will also contribute to your HSA for 2025 Interest accumulates tax-free, and funds are withdrawn tax-free to pay for medical expenses.

**Reduced out-of-pocket costs**

You can use the money in your HSA to pay for eligible medical, dental and vision expenses, and prescriptions. The HSA funds you use can help you meet your plan’s annual deductible.

**A long-term investment that stays with you**

 Unused account dollars are yours to keep even if you retire or leave the company. Also, you can invest your HSA funds, so your available healthcare dollars can grow over time.

**The opportunity for long-term savings**

Save unused HSA funds from year to year — you can use this money to reduce future out-of-pocket health expenses. You can even save HSA dollars to use after you retire.

--------------------------------------

The IRS provides a list of eligible services and products that you can purchase with your HSA/FSA. It is your responsibility to make sure you are eligible to contribute to your HSA/FSA, your contributions are within the IRS limits, and you are using your HSA/FSA for qualified medical expenses. For more details, see ([Publication 969](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-969 "Publication 969")). Once there go to the current revision and choose (Publication 969 PDF) to learn more about this type of account. Visit irs.gov for a list of qualified medical expenses ([Publication 502](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-502 "Publication 502")).

Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
-------------------------------

A great way to plan ahead and save money over the course of a year is to participate in an FSA. An FSA lets you redirect a portion of your salary on a pretax basis into a reimbursement account, saving you money on taxes. Each year that you would like to participate in the FSAs, you must elect the amount you want to contribute.

### Eligibility

If you are contributing to an HSA through Waterfield Technologies or through your spouse’s plan, you are not eligible to participate in the healthcare FSA.

### Healthcare flexible spending account

The healthcare FSA can be used to pay for eligible out-of-pocket medical, dental, vision and prescription drug expenses.

Money from this account can be used to pay qualified medical, dental and vision expenses. Each year that you would like to participate in the FSAs, you must elect the amount you want to contribute. Funds in the healthcare FSA are available at the beginning of the plan year and can be used for your expenses and those of your spouse and dependents, even if you and your family aren’t covered by our plan. The maximum contribution in 2024 for the healthcare flexible spending account is $3,050\* per household. If you are contributing to an HSA through our plan or through your spouse’s, you are not eligible to participate in the healthcare FSA.

Funds in the healthcare FSA are available at the beginning of the plan year and can be used for your expenses and those of your spouse and dependents, even if you and your family aren’t covered by our healthcare plan.

### Limited-purpose flexible spending account

If you are enrolled in the HSA plan, you are eligible to enroll in the limited-purpose flexible spending account. IRS rules state that you cannot have both an HSA and healthcare FSA since both apply funds toward your medical expenses. A limited-purpose FSA allows you to continue to contribute to an HSA. A limited-purpose FSA is much like a general healthcare FSA. The main difference is that the limited-purpose account is set up to reimburse only eligible FSA dental and vision expenses. The annual contribution limit for limited-purpose flexible spending accounts is $3,050\*.

Funds in the limited-purpose FSA are available at the beginning of the plan year and can be used for your expenses and those of your spouse and dependents, even if you and your family aren’t covered by our healthcare plan.

### Carryover benefit (healthcare FSA and limited-purpose FSA)

The maximum contribution in 2025 for the healthcare flexible spending account is $3,300\* per household. This is a use-it-or-lose-it account, meaning any funds remaining in the account following the close of the plan year will be forfeited. All services must be incurred from Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2025. Claims must be submitted by March 31, 2026. Our plan has a carryover feature that allows up to $660 of your unused funds to be carried forward to the following plan year. These carryover dollars can be used for expenses incurred at any point within the new plan year. Any unused amount over $660 will be lost.

\*IRS contribution limits subject to change.

### Dependent care flexible spending account

Dependent care FSAs allow you to set aside money pretax to pay eligible out-of-pocket day care expenses so that you or your spouse can work or attend school full time. You must contribute money through payroll deduction to your dependent care FSA before you can spend it.

During open enrollment, you must decide how much to set aside for this account in 2025. You may contribute up to $5,000, or up to $2,500 if you are married and file separate tax returns.

#### Eligible expenses examples

* Adult and child day care
* After-school care
* Babysitting (work-related, in your home or someone   
  else's home)
* Babysitting by your relative who is not a tax dependent   
  (work-related)
* Nanny or au pair
* Custodial elder care
* Transportation to and from eligible care (provided by

Dental insurance will be offered through Guardian. Although you can choose any dental provider, when you use an in-network dentist, you will generally pay less for treatments because your share of the cost will be based on negotiated discount fees. With out-of-network dentists, the plan will pay the same percentage but the reimbursement will be based on out-of-network rates. You may be billed for the difference.

Dental exams can tell your doctor a lot about your overall health. It’s important to schedule regular exams to help detect significant medical conditions before they become serious.

The oral and overall health connection
--------------------------------------

Periodontal disease is known to trigger the body’s inflammation response and adversely affect a number of different organs.

* **The brain:** Gum disease carries a stronger risk for stroke than diabetes. Research has found that the impact of gum disease is almost equivalent to high blood pressure, which is a major cause of strokes.
* **The heart:** Those with gum disease are almost twice as likely to suffer from heart disease compared to those with healthy gums.
* **The lungs:** Poor oral health may worsen respiratory illnesses by promoting the growth of harmful bacteria that can be transported to the lungs.
* **The pancreas:** Research suggests a significant association between gum disease and pancreatic cancer.
* **The kidneys:** The leading cause of tooth loss in adults is periodontal disease. And, edentulism, the condition of being toothless, is closely associated with chronic kidney disease.

**Other health concerns:** Periodontal disease is a cause for concern for pregnant women and diabetics. Expecting mothers who have gum disease are said to be four to seven times more likely to have a baby that is born too early or too small. Nearly 95 percent of Americans who have diabetes also have periodontal disease. Studies strongly suggest that this disease has the ability to disrupt blood sugar levels.

A distinct connection exists between the health of your mouth and that of your body. Research shows more than 120 illnesses can be identified in the mouth through a dental exam, including osteoporosis, bulimia, diabetes and oral cancer. Even more importantly, an unhealthy mouth can have harmful effects on the heart, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and brain.

Understand the underlying issue
-------------------------------

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one out of two Americans, 30 years of age or older, has periodontal disease. This translates to 64.7 million individuals with a mild, moderate or severe form of this gum condition.

Periodontal disease is a chronic bacterial infection that affects your gums and the bone supporting your teeth. It can occur for many reasons, including poor hygiene, unhealthy diet, smoking and stress.

Early gum disease, known as gingivitis, is characterized by red, swollen, bleeding gums. In this milder form of the disease, only the gums are affected. At this stage, the condition is treated with a proper oral health regime and regular dental visits. Gingivitis is usually reversible.

In the later stage of the disease, called periodontitis, gums are seriously damaged. Gums begin to pull away from the teeth, and supporting bone may be lost. This stage is irreversible and could require surgical treatments.

### Proactively protect your oral and overall health

Maintaining good oral health practices is essential to keeping your natural teeth strong and healthy as you age.

Establishing and maintaining good oral health is essential to your overall health and wellness.  
To prevent gum disease, be sure to:

* Brush at least twice a day (morning and evening) with fluoride toothpaste.
* Floss gently once a day.
* Drink fluoridated water.
* Eat wisely and limit sugary snacks and drinks.
* Avoid tobacco and limit alcohol.
* Visit your dentist twice a year.

Guardian’s vision care benefits include coverage for eye exams, standard lenses and frames, and contact lenses and discounts for laser surgery. The vision plan is built around a network of eye care providers, with better benefits at a lower cost to you when you use providers who belong to the VSP network. When you use an out-of-network provider, you will have to pay more for vision services.

Eye exams can tell your doctor a lot about your overall health. It’s important to schedule regular exams to help detect significant medical conditions before they become serious.

### Why your heart loves regular eye exams

Just as your primary care physician may listen to your heartbeat and check your blood pressure to monitor your heart rate, your eye doctor examines your eyes to get a clear look into your cardiovascular system. In fact, the eye is one of the only areas of the body where doctors have an unobstructed view of blood vessels. A full eye examination may reveal the first signs of serious heart conditions, including high blood pressure, before symptoms show up elsewhere in the body. And if not managed effectively, many of these cardiovascular conditions can lead to vision loss, too.

As part of your exam, your eye doctor may examine the retina to view small changes in the blood vessels in the back of the eye. This test can detect more serious diseases and is painless and noninvasive. Recent advancements such as digital retinal imaging enable your eye doctor to monitor all the structures of the retina over time.

### What your eyes say about your blood pressure

Known as the “silent” disease because its victims often lack symptoms, high blood pressure affects about one in three adults in the United States — while more than one in five people don’t even know they have it.1 A comprehensive eye exam, however, may uncover early signs of cardiovascular disease.

Your eye doctor can check for subtle changes in the retina that result from high blood pressure, a condition called hypertensive retinopathy.2 If your eye doctor sees these changes, he or she can refer you to your primary care physician, who can recommend further testing and treatment.

In some cases, vision loss can occur due to hemorrhages or hypertensive retinopathy. This condition happens when blood obstructs the retina, the eye is deprived of oxygen or the macula (the central part of the eye) swells. Obstruction of the arteries and blood vessels in the retina can be temporary or permanent.3  
By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you can help avoid risk factors that may affect heart health and vision. Take care of your heart and eyes by following these steps:

* Exercise regularly
* Maintain a proper weight
* Eat a heart-healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and soluble fiber

Consult with your medical doctor before starting any exercise or diet program. And don’t forget to see your eye care professional for regular eye exams. Your eyes and heart will thank you.

Hospitalization, physical therapy, intensive care, transportation and lodging are some of the out-of-pocket expenses that this accident insurance could cover. Coverage is available for you, your spouse and/or your child(ren). Accident insurance has an option of a low plan or a high plan.

**How does it work?**

Accident insurance provides a set benefit amount based on the type of injury you have and the type of treatment you need. It covers accidents that occur on and off the job, and a range of incidents, from common injuries to more serious events.

**Why is this coverage so valuable?**

It can help you with out-of-pocket costs that your medical plan doesn’t cover, like co-pays and deductibles. You’ll have base coverage without medical underwriting. The cost is conveniently deducted from your paycheck. You can keep your coverage if you change jobs or retire.

------------------

Hospital indemnity insurance through BCBS of OK is designed to help provide financial protection for covered individuals by paying a benefit for hospitalization. You can use the benefit to meet the out-of-pocket expenses and extra bills that can occur.

Hospital indemnity insurance has an option of a low plan or a high plan.

Critical Illness
----------------

Waterfield Technologies partners with BCBS of OK to offer critical illness insurance, which supplements major medical coverage by helping employees pay the direct and indirect costs associated with a critical illness or event. Some of the conditions covered under this program include cancer, heart attack, stroke, Alzheimer’s, kidney failure and paralysis. Benefits are paid tax-free in a lump sum to be used at your discretion. Child coverage is included with your employee election, and you also have the option of electing spouse coverage. New hires can elect up to the guaranteed issue amount without completing medical underwriting. If you do not enroll when you are first eligible, you will need to complete evidence of insurability if you choose to add coverage at a later date.

**How does it work?**

Critical Illness insurance allows you to elect $15,000 or $30,000 of coverage for yourself and $7,500 or $15,000 for your spouse and dependents. A lump sun benefit will be paid out depending on your diagnosis. You can also receive an annual $50 cash benefit for completing your annual wellness screening.

If you choose to purchase pet insurance through Nationwide, you may be able to cover up to 90% of your veterinary care expenses from any licensed veterinarian, specialist or emergency clinic in the country. The monthly premium paid for pet insurance will vary depending on the age, breed, location and gender of your pet, along with the coverage amount you elect.

**Helpful Terms**
=================

Here are some terms you may see that describe your benefits.
------------------------------------------------------------

**Balance Billing**

When a provider bills you for the balance remaining on the bill that your plan doesn’t cover. This amount is the difference between the actual billed amount and the allowed amount. For example, if the provider’s charge is $200 and the allowed amount is $110, the provider may bill you for the remaining $90. This happens most often when you see an out-of-network provider. A network provider may not bill you for covered services.

**Claim**

A request for a benefit (including reimbursement of a health care expense) made by you or your health care provider to your health insurer or plan for items or services you think are covered.

**Coinsurance**

Your share of the costs of a covered health care service, calculated as a percentage (for example, 20%) of the allowed amount for the service. You generally pay coinsurance plus any deductibles you owe. (For example, if the health insurance or plan’s allowed amount for an office visit is $100 and you’ve met your deductible, your coinsurance payment of 20% would be $20. The health insurance or plan pays the rest of the allowed amount.)

**Copay**

A fixed amount (for example, $15) you pay for a covered health care service, usually when you receive the service. The amount can vary by the type of covered health care service.

**Cost Sharing**

Your share of costs for services that a plan covers that you must pay out of your own pocket (sometimes called out-of-pocket costs). Some examples of cost sharing are copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance. Family cost sharing is the share of cost for deductibles and out-of-pocket costs you and your spouse and/or child(ren) must pay out of your own pocket. Other costs, including your premiums, penalties you may have to pay, or the cost of care a plan doesn’t cover usually aren’t considered cost sharing.

**Deductible**

An amount you could owe during a coverage period (usually one year) for covered health care services before your plan begins to pay. An overall deductible applies to all or almost all covered items and services. A plan with an overall deductible may  
also have separate deductibles that apply to specific services or groups of services. A plan may also have only separate deductibles. (For example, if your deductible is $1,000, your plan won’t pay anything until you’ve met your $1,000 deductible for covered health care services subject to the deductible.)

**Embedded Deductible**

If you are on a family medical plan with an embedded deductible, your plan contains two components: an individual deductible and a family deductible. Having two components to the deductible allows each member of your family to have your insurance policy cover their medical bills prior to the entire dollar amount of the family deductible being met. The individual deductible is embedded in the family deductible.

**Explanation of Benefits (EOB)**

An EOB is a statement from the insurance company showing how claims were processed. The EOB tells you what portion of the claim was paid to the healthcare provider and what portion of the payment, if any, you are responsible for.

**Emergency Medical Transportation**

Ambulance services for an emergency medical condition. Types of emergency medical transportation may include transportation by air, land, or sea. Your plan may not cover all types of emergency medical transportation, or may pay less for certain types.

**Emergency Room Care/Emergency Services** Services to check for an emergency medical condition and treat you to keep an emergency medical condition from getting worse. These services may be provided in a licensed hospital’s emergency room or other place that provides care for emergency medical conditions.

**Health Insurance**

A contract that requires a health insurer to pay some or all of your health care costs in exchange for a premium. A health insurance contract may also be called a “policy” or “plan.”

**Hospitalization**

Care in a hospital that requires admission as an inpatient and usually requires an overnight stay. Some plans may consider an overnight stay for observation as outpatient care instead of inpatient care.

**Hospital Outpatient Care**

Care in a hospital that usually doesn’t require an overnight stay.

**Individual Responsibility Requirement**

Sometimes called the “individual mandate”, the duty you may have to be enrolled in health coverage that provides minimum essential coverage. If you don’t have minimum essential coverage, you may have to pay a penalty when you file your federal income tax return unless you qualify for a health coverage exemption.

**In-network Coinsurance**

Your share (for example, 20%) of the allowed amount for covered healthcare services. Your share is usually lower for in-network covered services.

**In-network Copayment**

A fixed amount (for example, $15) you pay for covered health care services to providers who contract with your health insurance or plan. In-network copayments usually are less than out-of-network copayments.

**Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit**

Yearly amount the federal government sets as the most each individual or family can be required to pay in cost sharing during the plan year for covered, in-network services. Applies to most types of health plans and insurance. This amount may be higher than the out-of-pocket limits stated for your plan.

**Network Provider (Preferred Provider)**

A provider who has a contract with your health insurer or plan who has agreed to provide services to members of a plan. You will pay less if you see a provider in the network. Also called “preferred provider” or “participating provider.”

**Out-of-Network Coinsurance**

Your share (for example, 40%) of the allowed amount for covered health care services to providers who don’t contract with your health insurance or plan. Out-of-network coinsurance usually costs you more than in-network coinsurance.

**Out-of-Network Copayment**

A fixed amount (for example, $30) you pay for covered health care services from providers who do not contract with your health insurance or plan. Out-of-network copayments usually are more than in-network copayments.

**Out-of-network Provider (Non-Preferred Provider)**

A provider who doesn’t have a contract with your plan to provide services. If your plan covers out-of-network services, you’ll usually pay more to see an out-of-network provider than a preferred provider. Your policy will explain what those costs may be. May also be called “non-preferred” or “non-participating” instead of “out-of-network provider”.

**Out-of-Pocket Limit**

The most you could pay during a coverage period (usually one year) for your share of the costs of covered services. After you meet this limit the plan will usually pay 100% of the allowed amount. This limit helps you plan for health care costs. This limit never includes your premium, balance-billed charges or health care your plan doesn’t cover. Some plans don’t count all of your copayments, deductibles, coinsurance payments, out-of-network payments, or other expenses toward this limit.

**Plan**

Health coverage issued to you directly through an employer, union or other group sponsor (employer group plan) that provides coverage for certain health care costs. Also called "health insurance plan", "policy", "health insurance policy" or "health insurance".

**Preauthorization**

A decision by your health insurer or plan that a health care service, treatment plan, prescription drug or durable medical equipment (DME) is medically necessary. Sometimes called prior authorization, prior approval or precertification. Your health insurance or plan may require preauthorization for certain services before you receive them, except in an emergency. Preauthorization isn’t a promise your health insurance or plan will cover the cost.

**Premium**

The amount that must be paid for your health insurance or plan. You and/or your employer usually pay it monthly, quarterly, or yearly.

**Prescription Drug Coverage**  
Coverage under a plan that helps pay for prescription drugs. If the plan’s formulary uses “tiers” (levels), prescription drugs are grouped together by type or cost. The amount you'll pay in cost sharing will be different for each "tier" of covered prescription drugs.

**Preventive Care (Preventive Service)**

Routine health care, including screenings, check-ups, and patient counseling, to prevent or discover illness, disease, or other health problems.

**Primary Care Provider**

A physician, including an M.D. (Medical Doctor) or D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine), nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant, as allowed under state law and the terms of the plan, who provides, coordinates, or helps you access a range of health care services.

**Provider**  
An individual or facility that provides health care services. Some examples of a provider include a doctor, nurse, chiropractor, physician assistant, hospital, surgical center, skilled nursing facility, and rehabilitation center. The plan may require the provider to be licensed, certified, or accredited as required by state law.

**Reasonable and Customary**

The amount of money a health plan determines is the normal or acceptable range of charges for a specific health-related service or medical procedure. If your healthcare provider submits higher charges than what the health plan considers normal or acceptable, you may have to pay the difference.

**Referral**

A written order from your primary care provider for you to see a specialist or get certain health care services. In many health maintenance organizations (HMOs), you need to get a referral before you can get health care services from anyone except your primary care provider. If you don’t get a referral first, the plan may not pay for the services.

**Rehabilitation Services**

Health care services that help a person keep, get back, or improve skills and functioning for daily living that have been lost or impaired because a person was sick, hurt, or disabled. These services may include physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and psychiatric rehabilitation services in a variety of inpatient and/or outpatient settings.

**Screening**

A type of preventive care that includes tests or exams to detect the presence of something, usually performed when you have no symptoms, signs, or prevailing medical history of a disease or condition.

**Specialist**

A provider focusing on a specific area of medicine or a group of patients to diagnose, manage, prevent, or treat certain types of symptoms and conditions.

**Specialty Drug**

A type of prescription drug that, in general, requires special handling or ongoing monitoring and assessment by a health care professional, or is relatively difficult to dispense. Generally, specialty drugs are the most expensive drugs on a formulary.

**UCR (Usual, Customary and Reasonable)**

The amount paid for a medical service in a geographic area based on what providers in the area usually charge for the same or similar medical service. The UCR amount sometimes is used to determine the allowed amount.

**Urgent Care**

Care for an illness, injury, or condition serious enough that a reasonable person would seek care right away, but not so severe as to require emergency room care.
