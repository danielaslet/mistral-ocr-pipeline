Important Questions
Answers
Why This Matters:
What is the overall
deductible?
Network: $1,500 Individual / $3,000 Family
Out-of-Network: $4,000 Individual / $8,000 Family
Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the
deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family
members on the plan, each family member must meet their own individual
deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all family
members meets the overall family deductible.
Are there services
covered before you meet
your deductible?
Yes. Services that charge a copayment, prescription
drugs, ambulance, certain preventive care, and Network
diagnostic tests are covered before you meet your
deductible.
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the
deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For
example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost sharing
and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive
services at www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.
Are there other
deductibles for specific
services?
Yes. Per occurrence: $300 Out-of-Network inpatient
admission. There are no other specific deductibles.
You must pay all of the costs for these services up to the specific
deductible amount before this plan begins to pay for these services.
What is the out-of-pocket
limit for this plan?
Network: $5,500 Individual / $11,000 Family
Out-of-Network: $12,000 Individual / $24,000 Family
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered
services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet
their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has
been met.
What is not included in
the out-of-pocket limit?
Premiums, balance-billing charges, preauthorization
penalties, and health care this plan doesn't cover.
Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-
pocket limit.
Will you pay less if you
use a network provider?
Yes. See www.bcbsok.com or call 1-800-942-5837 for a
list of network providers.
This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider
in the plan's network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network
provider, and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference
between the provider's charge and what your plan pays (balance billing).
Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for
some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get
services.
Do you need a referral to
see a specialist?
No.
You can see the specialist you choose without a referral.
