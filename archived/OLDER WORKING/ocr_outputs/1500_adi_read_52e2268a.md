list of network providers.
Do you need a referral to
see a specialist?
No.
Yes. Services that charge a copayment, prescription
drugs, ambulance, certain preventive care, and Network
diagnostic tests are covered before you meet your
deductible.

Out-of-Network: $12,000 Individual / $24,000 Family
Premiums, balance-billing charges, preauthorization
penalties, and health care this plan doesn't cover.
Why This Matters:
Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the
deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family
members on the plan, each family member must meet their own individual
deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all family
members meets the overall family deductible.
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the
deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For
example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost sharing
and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive
services at www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.
You must pay all of the costs for these services up to the specific
deductible amount before this plan begins to pay for these services.
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered
services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet
their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has
been met.
Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-
pocket limit.
This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider
in the plan's network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network
provider, and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference
between the provider's charge and what your plan pays (balance billing).
Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for
some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get
services.
You can see the specialist you choose without a referral.
