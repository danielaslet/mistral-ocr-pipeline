<h1>How it works</h1>
<h2>Consider this scenario:</h2>
<p>Mark received an email from what
he thought was his bank asking
him to update his account info.
He did so and, shortly after, was
contacted about an attempt to add
a new user to his bank account.
He realized this may have been
a phishing scam and alerted
Aura&rsquo;s fraud expert team right
away. A Resolution Specialist
helped him quickly resolve
the issue.</p>
<p>*This is a hypothetical example
for illustrative purposes only.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>Why is having identity &amp; fraud protection so important?</h2>
<p>A. Everything you do is online, which makes your personal info more vulnerable. Get peace of mind
knowing that you&rsquo;ve taken a big step in protecting yourself from online threats, identity theft, and
fraud.</p>
<h2>What are some of the benefits of this protection?</h2>
<p>A. Aura offers robust protection by monitoring your personal info, credit, finances, and devices
and alerting you of suspicious activity. It&rsquo;s proactive protection to help stop threats before they strike.
If you are a victim of fraud, an experienced Resolution Specialist will help you navigate credit
bureaus, help initiate credit freezes or a credit lock, and work with you to resolve your fraud incident.</p>
<h2>Who can I protect with a Family plan?</h2>
<p>A. Account owners can add up to 10 adults to their plan. There are no restrictions on adult family
members - no matter where they live, their age, relationship, or whether they are financially
dependent on the employee. Each adult member gets their own private, full-feature Aura account.</p>
<p>Account owners may also add unlimited minors (under 18) to their plan if they have parental
guardianship rights over the minor. The minor&rsquo;s alerts will be available for only the account owner to
review.</p>
<h2>How do I pay for my identity and fraud protection?</h2>
<p>A. Fees will be paid through payroll deduction, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about writing a check or
missing a payment. For Employer-paid plans, any buy-up is paid via credit card directly to Aura.</p>
<h2>What else do I get?</h2>
<p>A. Every digital security plan comes with $5 million identity theft insurance6 and 24/7/365 U.S .- based
