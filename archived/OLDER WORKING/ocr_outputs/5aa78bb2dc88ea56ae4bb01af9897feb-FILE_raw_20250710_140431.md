# Blue Preferred PPO SM Blue Preferred PPOSM Network SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

This is your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS. It shows your cost share including deductible amounts, copayment
amounts, and coinsurance amounts and how they apply to the covered services you receive under this
plan. The information below summarizes your cost share and any limits that may apply to covered
services. You may contact Customer Service at the telephone number on the back of your member
identification card for any questions or additional information.

To receive maximum benefits under your Certificate, you must receive services from Blue Preferred
providers in Oklahoma or BlueCard providers outside the state of Oklahoma. These are your in-network
providers.

How cost sharing works:

. The deductible amounts and copayment amounts listed in the charts below show the amounts you
pay for covered services.

. Coinsurance amounts, if any, listed in the charts below are the percentage of the allowable
amount you pay. You may have to satisfy deductible amount(s), copayment amount(s) and/or
coinsurance amount(s) before you receive services.

· Your benefit period is a period of one year beginning on January 1 of each year. When you first
enroll under this plan, your coverage begins on the date shown above and ends on the first day of
the month of the following year. For example 01-01-2025 to 12-31-2025.

# Blue Preferred PPOSM SUMMARY OF BENEFITS for PHARMACY BENEFITS

This is your summary of benefits for prescription drugs. It shows your cost share including deductible
amounts, copayment amounts and coinsurance amounts and how they apply to the covered
prescription drugs you receive under this plan. The information below summarizes your cost share and
any limits that may apply to prescription drugs. You may contact Customer Service at the telephone
number on the back of your member identification card or access your self-service online member
portal, Blue Access for MembersSM (BAM) for any questions or additional information regarding your
benefits or prescription drug list.

The drug list also shows the coverage tier for covered services:

· Tier 1 - includes mostly generic drugs and may contain some brand-name prescription drugs.

· Tier 2 - includes mostly brand name drugs (preferred) and may contain some generic drugs.

· Tier 3 - includes mostly brand name drugs (non-preferred) and may contain some generic drugs.

· Tier 4 - includes mostly specialty drugs and may contain some generic drugs.

The PHARMACY BENEFITS section of this benefit booklet includes details on how the following
pharmacy benefits work per benefit period:

· How copayment and/coinsurance amounts apply

· How payment is determined (i.e., what are the tiers)

· Prior authorizations

· Limitations and exclusions

. In addition to your copayment and/or coinsurance amounts, when your prescription order is filled at an out-of-network
pharmacy you will be responsible for an additional 20% of the allowable charge determined by us. Only the copayment
or coinsurance will accumulate toward satisfaction of your out of pocket maximum.

Any difference between the allowable charge of a brand name drug and the allowable charge of a generic
drug for which you are responsible does apply to the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-GP-RX-SOB (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="9" -->
<!-- PageFooter="SUMMARY OF BENEFITS for PHARMACY BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

You may not be required to pay the difference in cost between the allowable charge of the brand name drug
and the allowable charge of the generic drug if there is both:

· a medical reason (e.g., adverse event) you need to take the brand name drug

· certain criteria are met

Your provider can submit a request to waive the difference in cost between the allowable charge of the brand
name drug and allowable charge of the generic drug. In order for this request to be reviewed:

· Your physician or other provider must send in a MedWatch form to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to let them know the issues you experienced with the generic equivalent.

· Your physician or other provider must provide a copy of this form when requesting the waiver.

The FDA MedWatch form is used to document adverse events, therapeutic inequivalence/failure, product
quality problems, and product use/medication error. This form is available on the FDA website. If the waiver is
granted, applicable copayment and/or coinsurance amounts will still apply. For additional information, contact
Customer Service at the number on the back of your identification card or visit www.bcbsok.com.

Any amounts paid by you, or on your behalf, for a covered prescription drug will be used to calculate your cost-
sharing requirements.

NOTE: The amount you may pay for a covered insulin drug shall not exceed $30 per 30-day supply or $90 per
90-day supply.

# INTRODUCTION

This is your health insurance benefit booklet. It describes your covered services, what they are and how
you obtain them.

The defined terms throughout this booklet are in bold font and are defined in the GLOSSARY or defined
within the applicable section when used only the one time.

The terms "you", "your", "participant" and "member" are used in this benefit booklet in reference to the
employee or subscriber, as applicable.


## In-Network Benefits

Your coverage is a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan. To receive in-network benefits as shown
under your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS (SOB), you must choose participating providers within the network
of your plan (except for emergencies). We have established a network of physicians, providers,
specialists, hospitals, and other health care facilities that may offer care and covered services to you
and your covered dependents. They are listed in our provider directory. For help in finding an in-network
provider you can view our provider directory by visiting our website at www.bcbsok.com.

When you choose an in-network provider, the provider will bill us, not you, for services
provided.


## Out-of-Network Benefits

If you choose an out-of-network provider, only out-of-network benefits will be available (except for
emergencies or any other covered benefit required by state or federal law to be covered as in-network).
If you go to a provider outside the network, then benefits will be paid at the out-of-network benefit level.
You may have to pay in full and then submit a claim to us for reimbursement.


## Your Insurance Identification Card

We will mail you your identification card. Show your identification card each time you receive services
from a provider. If you haven't received it before you need covered services, or if you lose it, you can
print a temporary card on the member website at www.bcbsok.com/member. Only covered dependents
on your plan can use your identification card. Duplicate cards can be requested for each covered
member of your family.


## About Your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

Your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS shows the out-of-pocket costs you are responsible for when you receive
covered services. It may also show benefit limitations or other useful information that apply to your
plan.

Out-of-pocket costs include things like deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. Limitations include
things like maximum age, visits, days, hours, and admissions.

Your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS will also show any total maximum out-of-pocket limit(s) that may apply.
You are responsible for paying your part of the cost sharing. You are also responsible for costs not
covered by us.

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->
<!-- PageFooter="INTRODUCTION" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

See HOW THE PLAN WORKS below and your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS for more information.


# What Medical Necessity/Medically Necessary Means

You will see the terms medical necessity or medically necessary in your benefit booklet. The GLOSSARY
defines it but resources like Customer Service or Blue Access for MembersSM (BAM) can get help with
questions on whether specific services meet the requirements to be considered medically necessary or
meet medical necessity.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="6" -->
<!-- PageFooter="INTRODUCTION" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


# WHO GETS BENEFITS

No separate eligibility rules or variations in premium will be imposed on you based on any health status
related factor. Benefits under this plan are provided regardless of your race, color, national origin, sex,
age, disability, or other status protected by applicable law. Variations in the administration, processes
or benefits provided under the plan that are based on clinically indicated, reasonable medical
management practices, or are part of permitted wellness incentives, disincentives and/or programs do
not constitute prohibited discrimination.


## Eligibility Requirements

The eligibility date is the date you or your dependents qualify to be covered under this plan. You qualify
for coverage under this benefit booklet when you satisfy the following:

· Meet the definition of an eligible person as specified by your employer.

· Have applied for this coverage.

· Have received a BCBSOK insurance identification card.

The date you become an eligible person is the date you satisfy the eligibility provisions specified by your
employer. Check with your Group Administrator for specific eligibility requirements which apply to your
coverage.

If you apply for coverage, you may include your dependents. Eligible dependents are:

· Your spouse

· Your domestic partner (Note: domestic partner coverage is available at your employer's
discretion. Contact your employer for information on whether domestic partner coverage is
available for your group).

· Your child until the month they turn age 26

· A child such as a stepchild, an eligible foster child, an adopted child or child placed for adoption
(including a child for whom you, your spouse or your domestic partner is a party in a legal action
in which the adoption of the child is sought), under 26 years of age.

· A child who is medically certified as disabled and dependent upon you, your spouse, or domestic
partner, is eligible to continue coverage beyond age 26, provided the disability began before the
child turned age 26.

Disabled means any medically determinable physical or mental condition that prevents the child from
engaging in self-sustaining employment. The disability must begin while the child is covered under the
plan and before the child reaches the limiting age. You must give satisfactory proof of the disability and
dependency through your employer to us within 31 days following the child's attainment of the limiting
age. As a condition to the continued coverage of a child as a disabled dependent beyond the limiting
age, we may require periodic certification of the child's physical or mental condition but not more often
than annually after the two-year period following the child's attainment of the limiting age.


## Applying For Coverage

You and your eligible dependents can apply for coverage during the following time periods by contacting
your employer:

· During the open enrollment period

· At special enrollment periods during the year

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->

dependents.

enrollee. You will become eligible to apply for coverage during your employer's next open enrollment
period. Your coverage will become effective on the contract date.

Coverage begins from the date of event if you apply for this change within 31 days of any of the following
qualifying events:

· You gain a dependent through marriage, establishment of a domestic partnership or court
ordered coverage.

However, if a court has ordered you to provide coverage, the effective date will be determined by the
plan in accordance with the provisions of the court order following the date the application for coverage
is received.

Coverage is automatic for the first 31 days for the following qualifying events. For coverage to continue
beyond this time, you must apply for this change within the 31-day period:

· You gain a dependent through birth, adoption or placement for adoption, legal guardianship or

as a fraudulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact in connection with the
plan).

· If it was required, you stated in writing that you and your dependent were covered by other
health insurance or COBRA continuation coverage as reason for declining enrollment in this
coverage.


## COBRA Continuation Coverage

This provision may not apply to your group's coverage. Please check with your group administrator to
determine if your group is subject to COBRA regulations.

Eligibility for Continuation Coverage

When a qualifying event occurs, eligibility under this Certificate may continue for you and/or your eligible
dependents (including your widow/widower, your divorced or legally separated spouse, and your
children) who were covered on the date of the qualifying event. A child who is born to you, or placed for
adoption with you, during the period of COBRA continuation coverage is also eligible to elect COBRA
continuation coverage.

You or your eligible dependent is responsible for notifying the employer within 60 days of the occurrence
of any of the following events:

· Your divorce or legal separation; or

· Your dependent child ceasing to be an eligible dependent under the plan; or

. The birth, adoption or placement for adoption of a child while you are covered under COBRA
continuation coverage.

A domestic partner is not recognized as a spouse for certain federally regulated programs, such as
COBRA Continuation Coverage and Medicare.


### Election of Continuation Coverage

You or your eligible dependent must elect COBRA continuation coverage within 60 days after the later
to occur of:

· The date the qualifying event would cause you or your dependent to lose coverage; or

. The date your employer notifies you, or your eligible dependent, of your COBRA continuation
coverage rights.


### COBRA Continuation Coverage Period

You and/or your eligible dependents are eligible for coverage to continue under your group's coverage
for a period not to exceed:

. 18 months from the date of a loss in coverage resulting from a qualifying event involving your
termination of employment or reduction in working hours; or

. 36 months from the date of a loss in coverage resulting from a qualifying event involving:

o your death, divorce or legal separation, or your loss of coverage due to becoming entitled
☐
to Medicare; or

o the ineligibility of a dependent child;
☐

provided the premiums are paid for the coverage as required.

Disability Extension

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="10" -->
<!-- PageFooter="WHO GETS BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

. COBRA continuation coverage may be extended from 18 months to 29 months for you or an
eligible dependent who is determined by the Social Security Administration to have been
disabled on the date of a qualifying event, or within the first 60 days of COBRA continuation
coverage.

o This 11-month disability extension is also available to nondisabled family members who are
entitled to COBRA continuation coverage.

. To request the 11-month disability extension, you or your dependent must give notice of the
disability determination to the employer before the end of the initial 18-month COBRA
continuation coverage period, and no later than 60 days after the date of the Social Security
Administration's determination.

o In addition, you or your dependent must notify the employer within 30 days after the Social
☐
Security Administration makes a determination that you or your dependent is no longer
disabled.


## Multiple Qualifying Events

In the event an eligible dependent experiences a second qualifying event after onset of COBRA
continuation coverage resulting from your termination or reduction in work hours, the maximum period
of coverage is 36 months from the date of a loss in coverage resulting from the first qualifying event. This
extension is available to the eligible dependent only.


## Special TAA/ATAA Election Period

An employee who loses his/her job due to a trade-related reason may be entitled to a second 60-day
COBRA election period if the employee did not elect COBRA continuation coverage when initially eligible
to do so. In order to qualify for this election period, the U.S. Department of Labor (or a state labor agency)
must issue a certification showing that the job loss was due to trade-related reasons and that the
employee is entitled to "trade adjustment assistance" (TAA) or "alternate trade adjustment assistance"
(ATAA). The special 60-day election period begins on the first day of the month in which the employee
becomes eligible for trade adjustment assistance, as determined by the Department of Labor or state
labor agency. The employee is not eligible for the special election period if the TAA/ATAA eligibility
determination is made more than six months after termination of employment.

# HOW THE PLAN WORKS

Your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS lists what you pay for each type of covered service. In general, this is
how your benefits work:

· You pay the deductible when it applies. Then we, the plan, and you, the participant, share the
expense. Your share is called a copayment or a coinsurance amount.

· Then we, the plan, pay the entire expense after you reach your out-of-pocket maximum.

· Expenses in this general rule means the allowable amount for services received from an in-
network provider and an out-of-network provider.

o You have an in-network deductible and an out-of-network deductible

o You have an in-network out-of-pocket maximum and an out-of-network out-of-pocket


## Allowable Amount

The allowable amount is the maximum amount of benefits we will pay for expenses you incur under the
plan. We have established an allowable amount for:

· Medically necessary services, supplies, and procedures provided by in-network providers that
have contracted with us or in some instances with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans; and

· Medically necessary services, supplies, and procedures provided by out-of-network providers
that have not contracted with us or any other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans.

When you choose to receive medically necessary services, supplies, or care from a provider that does not
contract with us, you will be responsible for any difference between our out-of-network allowable
amount and the amount charged by the out-of-network provider. You may have to pay the out-of-
network provider's charges in full and then submit a claim to us for reimbursement.

You will also be responsible for the charges incurred for services, supplies, and procedures limited or not
covered under the plan.


## Deductible(s)

Benefits under your plan will be available after you meet your deductible(s) as shown on your
SUMMARY OF BENEFITS.

How Individual Deductibles Work:

· Benefits will be available after your individual deductible amount, shown under your SUMMARY
OF BENEFITS, has been met.

How Family Deductibles Work:

· Family deductible amounts are for all covered family members combined.

· If a single-family member reaches the individual deductible shown under your SUMMARY OF
BENEFITS, they will be eligible for benefits and do not have to wait for other family members to
meet their deductible. This is known as an embedded family deductible.

· A family member may not apply more than the individual deductible amount toward the family
deductible amount.

· Should two or more members of your family ever receive covered services due to injuries
received in the same accident, only one program deductible will be applied against those covered
services.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="12" -->
<!-- PageFooter="HOW THE PLAN WORKS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

The benefit period deductible applies to all covered services except:

· In-network provider services that are subject to the office visit copayment.

. Routine nursery care.

. Preventive care services received from an in-network provider. Preventive care services
received from an out-of-network provider are subject to deductible, except for:

o Annual mammography screening;

o Covered childhood immunizations (for members under age 19);

o Any other state or federally mandated benefits which stipulate a deductible may not be
required.

· Prescription drugs.

The deductible and out-of-pocket maximum amounts under this plan follow applicable law. In case of
a change in the law, the amounts will be adjusted accordingly.

Until the benefit period deductible is satisfied, benefits will be available only for those services or
supplies for preventive services received from an in-network provider and for those services or supplies
subject to a copayment, such as physician office visits, and covered drugs under pharmacy benefits,
unless otherwise listed as an exception above.


## Copayments/Copays

Some of the care and treatment you receive under the plan will require that a copayment be paid at the
time you receive the services. Refer to your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS for your copayments.

Copayments do not apply to services received from out-of-network providers.

The following covered services are not subject to an office visit copayment. Benefits will be provided at
the payment levels shown in your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS. Services may be subject to deductible
and/or coinsurance (if applicable):

· Any services provided during the office visit or at the time of consultation (i.e., lab and x-ray
services)

· Surgery performed in the physician's office

· Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and manipulative therapy billed
separately from an office visit

· Allergy injections billed separately from an office visit

· Therapeutic injections

. Any services requiring prior authorization

· Certain diagnostic procedures

· Diagnostic imaging service such as:

o magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

o computed tomography (CT)

o positron emission tomography (PET)

o myocardial perfusion studies (MPS)

o and other similar imaging tests

· Services provided by an independent laboratory, imaging center, radiologist, pathologist, and
anesthesiologist

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="13" -->
<!-- PageFooter="HOW THE PLAN WORKS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

· Outpatient treatment therapies or services such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and renal
dialysis

· Prescription drugs

· Durable medical equipment (DME)


## Out-of-Pocket Maximum

The out-of-pocket maximum is the total amount of deductibles, copayments and/or coinsurance which
must be satisfied during your benefit period for all covered services received from in-network providers
before we (your plan) will begin to cover all charges at 100% for the remainder of the benefit period.


### How Individual Out-of-Pocket Maximums Work

When you have met the out-of-pocket maximum specified in your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS, no
additional deductible, copayment and/or coinsurance will be required for covered services you receive
during the remainder of your benefit period.


### How Family Out-of-Pocket Maximums Work

If you have family coverage and your family's out-of-pocket payments during the benefit period equals
the family out-of-pocket maximum shown under the SUMMARY OF BENEFITS then for the rest of the
benefit period, all family members will have benefits for covered services (except for those charges
specifically excluded below) paid by us at 100% of the allowable amount.

The out-of-pocket maximum will not include:

. Any penalty incurred due to your failure to follow the plan's requirements for prior authorization

· Services, supplies, or charges limited or excluded by the plan

· Expenses not covered because a benefit maximum has been reached

· Any expense paid by the primary plan when BCBSOK is the secondary plan for purposes of
coordination of benefits

The following are exceptions to the out-of-pocket maximum described above:

. There are combined out-of-pocket maximums for in-network benefits and out-of-network
benefits.


## Federal Balance Billing and Other Protections

This section is based upon the No Surprises Act, a federal law enacted in 2020 and effective for plan
years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Unless otherwise required by federal or Oklahoma law, if
there is a conflict between the terms of this Federal Balance Billing and Other Protections section and
the terms in the rest of this Certificate, the terms of this section will apply.


## Protections From Unexpected Costs for Medical Services From Non-Participating Providers

Your Certificate contains provisions related to protection from surprise balance billing under applicable
law. The federal laws provide additional financial protections for you when you receive some types of
care from providers who do not participate in your network. If you receive the types of care listed below,
your in-network cost-sharing levels will apply to any network deductible and out-of-pocket maximums.
Additionally, your cost-share amount may be calculated on an amount that generally represents the

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="14" -->
<!-- PageFooter="HOW THE PLAN WORKS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

median payment rate that BCBSOK has negotiated with participating providers for similar services in the
area:

· Emergency care from out-of-network providers or facilities

· Care furnished by out-of-network providers during your visit to an in-network facility

. Air ambulance services from out-of-network providers if the services would be covered if
received from an in-network provider

Out-of-network or non-participating providers may not bill you for more than your deductible,
coinsurance amount or copayments for the service types referenced above. There are limited instances
when an out-of-network or non-participating provider may send you a bill (for the care services
referenced above) for up to the amount of that provider's billed charges.

You are only responsible for payment of the non-participating provider's billed charges if, in
advance of receiving services, you signed a written notice form that complies with applicable
state and/or federal law.

The requirements of federal law that impact your costs for care from non-participating providers may
not apply in all cases. Oklahoma law provisions relating to balance billing prohibitions, if any, may apply.
You may contact us at the number on the back of your identification card with questions about claims
or bills you have received from providers.

To the extent state and federal regulations are adopted or additional guidance is issued by federal
regulatory agencies that alter the terms of this section, the regulations and any additional guidance will
control over conflicting language in this section.


## Continuity of Care

In the event you are under the care of an in-network provider and the provider stops participating in
the network (for reasons other than failure to meet applicable quality standards, including medical
incompetence or unprofessional behavior, or for fraud), we will continue providing coverage for you at
the in-network benefit level if you have one of the following special circumstances:

. You are undergoing a course of treatment for a serious and complex condition

· You are undergoing institutional or inpatient care

· You are scheduled to undergo non-elective surgery from the provider (including receipt of post-
operative care from such provider with respect to such surgery)

. You are pregnant or undergoing a course of treatment for the pregnancy

. You are terminally ill

Serious and complex condition means:

· Acute illness - condition serious enough to require specialized medical treatment to avoid the
reasonable possibility of death or permanent harm (for example, if you are currently receiving
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or post-operative visits for a serious acute disease or condition)

· Chronic illness or condition - condition is:

o life-threatening, degenerative, disabling or potentially disabling, or congenital, and
☐

o requires specialized medical care over a prolonged period of time.
☐

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="15" -->
<!-- PageFooter="HOW THE PLAN WORKS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

The continuity of coverage under this subsection shall continue until the treatment is complete but shall
not extend for more than ninety (90) days, or more than nine (9) months if you have been diagnosed
with a terminal illness, beyond the date the provider's termination from the network takes effect. If you
are pregnant and you are in your second or third trimester of pregnancy at the time the provider's
termination takes effect, continuity of coverage may be extended through delivery of the child,
immediate postpartum care, and the follow-up check-up within the first six (6) weeks of delivery.

### MedsYourWay™

MedsYourWay™ ("MedsYourWay") may lower your out-of-pocket costs for select covered drugs
purchased at select retail participating pharmacies. MedsYourWay is a program that automatically
compares available drug discount card prices and prices under your benefit plan for select covered drugs
and establishes your out-of-pocket cost to the lower price available. At the time you submit or pick up
your prescription, present your identification card to the pharmacist. This will identify you as a
participant in MedsYourWay and allow you the lower price available for select covered drugs.

The amount you pay for your prescription will be applied, if applicable, to your deductible and out-of-
pocket maximum. Available select covered drugs and drug discount card pricing through MedsYourWay
may change occasionally. Certain restrictions may apply and certain covered drugs or drug discount cards
may not be available for the MedsYourWay program. You may experience a different out-of-pocket
amount for select covered drugs depending upon which retail pharmacy is utilized. For additional
information regarding MedsYourWay, please contact a customer service representative at the toll-free
telephone number on the back of your identification card or access Blue Access for MembersSM (BAM).
Participation in MedsYourWay is not mandatory and you may choose not to participate in the program
at any time by contacting your customer service representative at the toll-free telephone number on the
back of your identification card or access Blue Access for MembersSM (BAM). In the event MedsYourWay
fails to provide, or continue to provide, the program as stated, there will be no impact to you. In such an
event, you will pay the amount shown on your SUMMARY OF BENEFITS.


### Payment of Benefits

Benefits are provided for prescription drugs dispensed for your use when recommended by and while
under the care of a physician or other provider, provided such care and treatment is medically
necessary.

· Benefits for prescription drugs are available to you only:

o in accordance with a prescription drug order; and

o after you have incurred charges equal to the copayment and/or coinsurance applicable to
each prescription drug order.

If the charge for your prescription is less than your copayment and/or coinsurance, you will pay
the lesser amount.

. When prescription drugs and related services are dispensed by a participating pharmacy we will
pay directly to the pharmacy the allowable charge for the drugs, less the applicable deductible,
copayment and/or coinsurance specified in the SUMMARY OF BENEFITS for PHARMACY
BENEFITS.

. When prescription drugs are dispensed by a pharmacy which is not a participating pharmacy,
benefits are reduced to 80% of the allowable charge for the drugs, less the applicable copayment
or coinsurance.

NOTE: Vaccinations administered by a pharmacy that is not a participating retail pharmacy
vaccination network provider are not covered under this PHARMACY BENEFITS section.

. You may not be required to pay the difference in cost between the allowable charge of the brand
name drug and the allowable charge of the generic drug if there is a medical reason (e.g., adverse
event) you need to take the brand name drug and certain criteria are met.

Your provider can submit a request to waive the difference in cost between the allowable charge
of the brand name drug and allowable charge of the generic drug.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="38" -->
<!-- PageFooter="PHARMACY BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

In order for this request to be reviewed, your provider must:

o Send in a MedWatch form to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to let them know the
issues you experienced with the generic equivalent.

o Provide a copy of this form when requesting the waiver.

The FDA MedWatch form is used to document adverse events, therapeutic inequivalence/failure,
product quality problems, and product use/medication error. This form is available on the FDA
website.

If the waiver is granted, applicable copayment and/or coinsurance amounts will still apply.

For additional information, contact the customer service number on the back of your
identification card or visit www.bcbsok.com.


### Prescription Drug Prior Authorization Process

We have designated certain drugs which require prior authorization in order for benefits to be available
under this Certificate.

You can obtain a listing of the drugs which require prior authorization by visiting our website at
www.bcbsok.com or contacting a Customer Service Representative at the number shown on your
identification card. Also, you may request a listing by writing to the Prescription Drug Benefits address
located in the CUSTOMER SERVICE section of this Certificate.

NOTE: the listing of drugs requiring prior authorization will change periodically as new drugs are
developed or as required to assure medical necessity.

If your physician or other provider prescribes a drug which requires prior approval, you, the physician
or other provider may request a prior authorization review by calling Customer Service at the number
listed on your identification card or visiting our website at www.bcbsok.com. Your request will be
reviewed within the required time frames. If you have a health condition that may jeopardize your life,
health or keep you from regaining function, you or your provider may be able to ask for an expedited
review process.

When you present your prescription order to a participating pharmacy, along with your identification
card, the pharmacist will submit an electronic claim to us to determine the appropriate benefits.

. If the prior authorization request is approved, your pharmacist will dispense the prescription
drug as prescribed and collect any applicable deductible, copayment and/or coinsurance
amount.

. If the prior authorization request is denied, you will be responsible for the full cost of your
prescription.

. If you purchase your prescriptions from an out-of-network (non-participating) pharmacy, or if
you do not have your identification card with you when you purchase your prescriptions, it will
be your responsibility to pay the full cost of the prescription drugs and to submit a claim form
(with your itemized receipt) to receive any benefits available under your prescription drug
program. Send the completed claim form to the Prescription Drug Claims address located in the
CUSTOMER SERVICE section of this Certificate.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="39" -->
<!-- PageFooter="PHARMACY BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

o If the drug you received is one which requires prior approval, we will review the claim to
determine if prior authorization approval would have been given.

o If so, benefits will be processed in accordance with your prescription drug coverage.

o If the prior authorization approval is denied, no benefits will be available under this
Certificate for the prescription drug order.

To view a listing of the drugs which are included in the prior authorization program, please visit our
website at https://www.bcbsok.com/rx-drugs/drug-lists/drug-lists. If you have questions about prior
authorization, please call a Customer Service Representative at the number shown on your
identification card for assistance.

Prior authorization means that in order to determine that a drug is safe, effective, and part of a specific
treatment plan, certain medications may require prior authorization and the evaluation of additional
clinical information and criteria before the drug is covered under your prescription drug program.

Step therapy programs do not apply to prescription drug treatment for the treatment of advanced,
metastatic cancer or associated conditions.

Coverage for prescription drug treatment for advanced, metastatic cancer or associated conditions do
not require you to fail to successfully respond to a different drug or provide a history of failure of a
different drug, before providing coverage of a prescription drug. This applies only to a prescription drug
treatment that is consistent with best practices for the treatment of advanced, metastatic cancer or an
associated condition; supported by peer-reviewed, evidence-based literature; and approved by the FDA.


<figure>

In addition to the GLOSSARY section of this benefit booklet, the following definitions are
applicable to this step therapy benefit:

. Advanced, metastatic cancer means a cancer that has spread from the primary or original
site of the cancer to nearby tissues, lymph nodes, or other areas or parts of the body.

. Associated conditions mean the symptoms or side effects associated with advanced,
metastatic cancer or its treatment and which, in the judgment of the provider, further
jeopardize the health of a patient if left untreated.

</figure>


### Prescription Drug Supply/Dispensing Limits

We have the right to determine the day supply limits at our sole discretion. Benefits may be denied if
drugs are dispensed or delivered in a manner intended to change, or having the effect of changing or
circumventing, the stated maximum supply limitations.


#### . Benefit Supply Limits per Prescription Order

For each copayment and/or coinsurance amount specified for your prescription drugs, you can
obtain the following supply of a single prescription drug or other item covered under this Certificate
(unless otherwise specified).

Benefits will be provided for prescription drugs dispensed in the following quantities:

o Retail pharmacy and specialty pharmacy network providers - During each one-month period,
up to a 30-day supply for prescription drugs and specialty pharmacy drugs. However, some
specialty drugs have FDA approved dosing regimens exceeding the 30-day supply limits and may

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="40" -->
<!-- PageFooter="PHARMACY BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

be allowed greater than a 30-day supply, if allowed by your plan benefits. Cost share will be
based on day supply (1-30-day supply, 31-50-day supply, 1-90-day supply) dispensed.

o Extended Prescription Drug Supply Program and Mail-Order Pharmacy Program - During each
three-month period, up to a 90-day supply for prescription drugs.

Benefits are not provided under your Certificate for charges for prescription drugs dispensed in
excess of the above stated amounts.

Benefits will not be provided for a prescription drug order refill until 75% of the previous
prescription drug order (or 70% for covered prescription eyedrops) has been used by you. An
exception to this provision may be granted on at least one occasion per year to synchronize your
prescription drug order refills for certain covered prescription drugs so that they are refilled on the
same schedule (for a given time period). When necessary to permit synchronization, we shall apply
a prorated daily cost-sharing rate to any covered medication dispensed by a participating pharmacy.
Some prescriptions may be subject to a shorter refill window. Please call Customer Service for details.


#### · Clinical Dispensing Limits Applicable to Certain Drugs

In addition to the supply limits stated above and regardless of the quantity of a covered prescription
drug prescribed by a physician or other provider, we have the right to establish dispensing limits on
covered prescription drugs. These limits, which are based upon FDA dosing recommendations and
nationally recognized clinical guidelines, identify gender or age restrictions, and/or the maximum
quantity of a drug (or member of a drug class) that can be dispensed to you over a specific period of
time. Such limits are in place to encourage appropriate drug use, patient safety, and reduce
stockpiling.

Benefits for a covered prescription drug may also be denied if the drug is dispensed or delivered in
a manner intended to avoid our established dispensing limit.

If you need a drug quantity that exceeds the dispensing limit, ask your doctor to submit a request for
review to us on your behalf. The request will be approved or denied after the clinical information
submitted by the prescribing provider has been evaluated by us.


#### . Controlled Substances Limitation

If we determine that you may be receiving quantities of controlled substance medications not
supported by FDA approved dosages or recognized safety or treatment guidelines, any coverage for
additional drugs may be subject to a review for medical necessity, appropriateness and other
coverage restrictions which may include but not limited to limiting coverage to services provided by
a certain provider and/or pharmacy for the prescribing and dispensing of the controlled substance
medication and/or limiting coverage to certain quantities.

Additional copayment and/or coinsurance may apply.

For the purposes of this provision, controlled substance medications are medications classified and
restricted by state or federal laws.

medical condition. Due to special storage requirements, specialty drugs should be obtained through

## UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT


### Utilization Management

Utilization management may be called a medical necessity review, which is used for a procedure, service,
inpatient admission, and/or length of stay and is based on our medical policy and nationally recognized
criteria.

Medical Necessity reviews may occur:

· Prior to care

· During care

· After care has been completed

Please refer to medical necessity or medically necessary in the GLOSSARY section of this benefit booklet
for additional information regarding any limitations and/or special conditions pertaining to your
benefits.


### Prior Authorization

You need pre-approval from us for some covered services. Pre-approval is also called prior
authorization. This ensures that certain covered services will not be denied based on medical necessity
or experimental/investigational.

Prior authorization does not guarantee payment of benefits. For additional information and a current
list of health care services that require prior authorization, please visit our website at
https://www.bcbsok.com/provider/claims/claims-eligibility/utilization-management/pa-lists


### Prior Authorization Responsibility In-Network Provider Prior Authorization

When required, your in-network provider is responsible for obtaining prior authorization. If your in-
network provider does not obtain prior authorization and the services are denied as not medically
necessary, the in-network provider will be held responsible and not be able to bill you.

We recommend you confirm with your provider if prior authorization has been obtained. For additional
information about prior authorization for services outside of our service area, please refer to the
BlueCard® Program section.

Note: Providers that contract with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are not familiar
with the prior authorization requirements of BCBSOK. Unless a provider contracts directly
with BCBSOK as a participating provider, the provider is not responsible for being aware of
this plan's prior authorization requirements, except as described in the section "The
BlueCard® Program" in the GENERAL PROVISIONS


### Out-of-Network Prior Authorization

If an out-of-network provider recommends an admission or service that requires prior authorization,
you are responsible for obtaining prior authorization. Call the number on the back of your identification
card.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="45" -->
<!-- PageFooter="UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

If the service is determined to be medically necessary, out-of-network benefits will apply. However, if
prior authorization is not obtained before services are received and determined to be not medically
necessary, you may be responsible for the charges.


### Response to Prior Authorization Requests

The plan will provide a written response to your prior authorization request within 7 days of obtaining
all necessary information to make the decision. This period may be extended one time for up to 15
additional days, if we determine that additional time is necessary due to matters beyond our control.

If the plan determines that additional time is necessary, we will notify you in writing, prior to the
expiration of the original 7-day period, that the extension is necessary, along with an explanation of the
circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the plan expects to make the
determination.

If an extension of time is necessary due to our need for additional information, we will notify you of the
specific information needed, and you will have 45 days from receipt of the notice to provide the
additional information. We will provide a written response to your request for prior authorization within
15 days following receipt of the additional information.

The procedure for appealing an adverse Prior Authorization determination is set forth in the section
entitled, CLAIM FILING AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.


### Response to Prior Authorization Requests Involving Urgent Care

A prior authorization request involving urgent care is any request for medical care or treatment with
respect to which the 7-day review period set forth above:

. This could seriously jeopardize your life or life or health or your ability to regain maximum
function; or

. in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, would subject you to
severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the
subject of the prior authorization request.

The plan will respond to you within 72 hours of obtaining all necessary information to make the decision.
If you fail to provide sufficient information, you will be notified of the missing information within 24 hours
and will have no less than 48 hours to provide the information. A benefit determination will be made as
soon as possible (taking into account medical exigencies) but no later than 72 hours after the initial
request, or within 48 hours after the missing information is received (if the initial request is incomplete).

The plan's response to your prior authorization request involving urgent care, including an adverse
determination, if applicable, may be issued orally. A written notice will also be provided within three days
following the oral notification.


### Length Of Stay/Service Review

Upon completion of the prior authorization process for inpatient services or the prior authorization
requests involving emergency care review, the plan will send a letter to you, your physician, behavioral
health practitioner and/or hospital or facility with a determination on the approved length of service or
length of stay.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="46" -->
<!-- PageFooter="UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

An extension of the length of stay/service will be based solely on whether continued inpatient care or
other health care service is medically necessary. If the extension is determined not to be medically
necessary, the coverage for the length of stay/service will not be extended, except as otherwise
described in the CLAIM FILING AND APPEALS PROCEDURE section under this Certificate.

A length of stay/service review, also known as a concurrent medical necessity review, is when you, your
provider, or other authorized representative may submit a request to the plan for continued services. If
you, your provider or authorized representative requests to extend care beyond the approved time limit
and it is a request involving urgent care or an ongoing course of treatment, the plan will make a
determination within 72 hours of receipt of the request.


### Recommended Clinical Review Option

A recommended clinical review is:

. An optional voluntary medical necessity review for a covered service that does not require a prior
authorization

· Occurs before, during or after services are completed

· Limits situations where you must pay for a non-approved service

To determine if a recommended clinical review is available for a specific service, please visit our website
at www.bcbsok.com/find-care/where-you-go-matters/utilization-management for the recommended
clinical review list.


#### Contacting Medical and Behavioral Health

You may contact us for a prior authorization or recommended clinical review by calling the toll-free
telephone number on the back of your identification card and following the prompts to the Medical or
Behavioral Health Unit or via the member portal.


#### Post-Service Medical Necessity Review

A post-service medical necessity review is sometimes referred to as a retrospective review or post-
service claims request and determines:

· Your eligibility

· Availability of benefits at the time of service

· Medical necessity


#### Failure to Obtain Prior Authorization

If prior authorization is not obtained:

. You may be responsible for a penalty for certain covered services, if indicated on your SUMMARY
OF BENEFITS.

. If we determine the treatment or service is not medically necessary or is
experimental/investigational, benefits will be reduced or denied.

. We will review the medical necessity of your treatment or service prior to the final benefit
determination.

Note: No provision found in this section guarantees payment of benefits. Actual availability of
benefits is subject to eligibility and the other terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions
under your plan.

treatment.

yet received and requires prior authorization.

## Claim Appeal Procedures Claim Appeal Procedures and Definitions

An adverse benefit determination means a denial, reduction, or termination of or a failure to provide or
make payment (in whole or in part) for, a benefit, including any such denial, reduction, termination, or
failure to provide or make payment for, a benefit resulting from the application of any utilization review,
as well as a failure to cover an item or service for which benefits are otherwise provided because it is
determined to be experimental, investigational and/or unproven or not medically necessary or
appropriate.

If an ongoing course of treatment had been approved by the plan and the plan reduces or terminates
such treatment (other than by amendment or termination of this Certificate) before the end of the
approved treatment period, that is also an adverse benefit determination.

Expedited Clinical Appeal means an appeal of a clinically urgent nature related to a denial of health care
services, including, but not limited to:

· Procedures or treatments ordered by a provider

· Continued hospitalization

· A step therapy exception request

. If you were receiving prescription drugs or intravenous infusions and coverage was discontinued

If your situation meets the definition of an expedited clinical appeal, you may be able to appeal our
decision on an expedited basis.

## Limitations on Plan's Right of Recoupment/Recovery

We will not seek recovery of all or a portion of a payment of a claim made to you more than twelve (12)
months or a provider more than eighteen (18) months after the payment is made. This paragraph shall

. if you or a provider has otherwise agreed to make a refund to the plan for overpayment of a
claim.


## Member Data Sharing

You may apply for and receive replacement coverage under certain circumstances like from involuntary
termination of your health coverage sponsored by the group/employer.

The replacement coverage will be coverage offered by us. If you do not live in the service area, coverage
will be offered by the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan whose service area covers the geographic area
where you live.

As part of the benefits that we offer you, if you do not live in the service area, we may assist you in
applying for and getting such replacement coverage, subject to applicable eligibility requirements, from
the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan available in the service area in which you live.

To do this we may:

· Contact you directly and/or

. Provide the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan whose service area covers the geographic area
where you live, with your personal information and other general information relating to your
coverage under this plan. Only your necessary information will be provided to prepare the
appropriate Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan to offer you uninterrupted coverage through
replacement coverage.


## Member Rewards Medical

Member Rewards is a free, program that you can choose that eligible participants can earn a percentage
of the claim savings in a cash reward by selecting quality, low-cost network facilities for qualified
elective, non- emergency medical services. Participants can use the Provider Finder tool on our website
at https://www.bcbsok.com/find-care/providers-in-your-network/find-a-doctor-or-hospital to find a list
of all eligible services and facility options. Shopping can also be done by calling the number on the back
of your insurance identification card, who will shop for services and facilities for you.

When you choose a rewards eligible service, you will earn a part of the savings in the form of a check
mailed to you, usually within 60 days. This reward is separate from and does not affect your claim for a
qualified service. To earn a reward, you must:

· Have active coverage on the date you shop for a rewards-eligible service

· Have active coverage on the date the medical service is given

· Complete the rewards-eligible service within thirteen months of shopping

Cash reward amounts and eligible services are subject to change; however, the maximum reward amount
you may earn on any single procedure is $500. Any reward amounts received may be taxable.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="59" -->
<!-- PageFooter="GENERAL PROVISIONS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Your provider may refer you to a facility or location to complete your medical service or procedure not
eligible for a reward. However, you must use a facility that is eligible for the program to receive a reward.
If your provider refers you to a facility that is not eligible for a reward under the program, customer
service may be able to work with your provider to find an eligible facility or location, if one is available.
Remember, all decisions on where to receive care are between you and your provider.

Member Rewards is not a discount program and will not change benefits or claims processing. The plan
may stop or change this program upon 180 days' notice to participants. To keep eligibility for a reward,
you must complete shopping for a rewards-eligible service prior to the program termination following a
program termination notice. Rewards may be paid out up to 90 days after program termination. All
rewards earned under this program will be funded by us, and subject to the provided provisions of this
program and all other applicable articles of coverage including payment of benefits, termination of
coverage, and review of claim determinations. A referral or prior authorization may be needed for your
procedure or service.

If you have questions about this program, call customer service or visit our website at www.bcbsok.com.


## Out-of-Area Services

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue
Shield Licensees referred to generally as "Inter-Plan Arrangements". These Inter-Plan Arrangements
work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Whenever you
access covered services outside the state of Oklahoma, you will receive it from one of two kinds of
providers. Most providers ("participating providers") contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue
Shield Licensee in that geographic area ("Host Blue"). Some providers ("non-contracting providers") do
not contract with the Host Blue. We explain how we pay both types below.


### . BlueCard® Program

Under the BlueCard® Program, when you receive covered services within the geographic area served
by a Host Blue, we will remain responsible for what we agreed to in the Certificate. However, the
Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its
participating providers.

For inpatient facility services received in a hospital, the Host Blue's participating provider is required
to obtain prior authorization. If prior authorization is not obtained, benefits will be reduced based
on the Host Blue's contractual agreement with the provider, and the Subscriber will be held harmless
for the provider sanction.

Whenever you receive covered services outside the state of Oklahoma and the claim is processed
through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the
lower of:

o The billed charges for your covered services; or

o The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to us.

Often, this "negotiated price" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue
pays to your health care provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special
arrangements with your health care provider or provider group that may include types of
settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="60" -->
<!-- PageFooter="GENERAL PROVISIONS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health care
providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price.

Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct
for over- or underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments
will not affect the price we use for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has
already been paid.


## . Non-Participating Providers Outside the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma Service Area


### o Liability Calculation

In general, when covered services are provided outside of the plan's service area by non-
participating providers, the amount(s) a Subscriber pays for such services will be calculated using
the methodology described in the Certificate for non-contracting providers located inside our
service area. You may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the non-
participating provider bills and the payment the plan will make for the covered services as set
forth in this paragraph. Payments for out-of-network emergency services are governed by
applicable federal and state law.


### o Exceptions

In some exception cases, the plan may, but is not required to, in its sole and absolute discretion,
negotiate a payment with such non-participating provider on an exception basis. If a negotiated
payment is not available, then the plan may make a payment based on the lesser of:

" The amount calculated using the methodology described in the Certificate for non-
participating providers located inside the state of Oklahoma (described above); or

" the following:

\- for professional providers, make a payment based on publicly available provider
reimbursement data for the same or similar professional services, adjusted for
geographical differences where applicable; or

\- for hospital or facility providers, make a payment based on publicly available data
reflecting the approximate costs that hospitals or facilities have incurred historically to
provide the same or similar service, adjusted for geographical differences where
applicable, plus a margin factor for the hospital or facility.

In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the non-
participating provider bills and the payment Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma will make
for the covered services as set forth above.


## · Inter-Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees

Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to
insured Employer accounts. If applicable, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma will include any
such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you.


## . Value-Based Programs

If you receive covered services under a Value-Based Program inside a Host Blue's service area,
you will not be responsible for paying any of the provider incentives, risk-sharing, and/or care
coordinator fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these
fees to the plan through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments.

<!-- PageBreak -->


## . Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core

If you are outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands
(hereinafter "BlueCard service area"), you may be able to take advantage of Blue Cross Blue Shield
Global Core when accessing covered services. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core is unlike the
BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard service area in certain ways. For instance, although Blue
Cross Blue Shield Global Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and
professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care
from providers outside the BlueCard service area, you will typically have to pay the providers and
submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services.

If you need medical assistance services (including locating a doctor or hospital) outside the BlueCard
service area, you should call the service center at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1-804-673-
1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. An assistance coordinator, working with a medical
professional, can arrange a physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary.


## o Inpatient Services

In most cases, if you contact the service center for assistance, hospitals will not require you to
pay for covered inpatient services, except for your deductibles, copayments and coinsurance,
etc. In such cases, the hospital will submit your claims to the service center to begin claims
processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of service, you must submit a claim to receive
reimbursement for covered services.

You must contact Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma to obtain prior authorization for non-
emergency inpatient services.

o Outpatient Services

Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard
service area will typically require you to pay in full at the time of service. You must submit a claim
to obtain reimbursement for covered services.


## o Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim

When you pay for covered services outside the BlueCard service area, you must submit a claim
to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, you should complete a Blue
Cross Blue Shield Global Core International claim form and send the claim form with the
provider's itemized bill(s) to the service center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims
processing. Following the instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of
your claim. The claim form is available from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma, the service
center or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. If you need assistance with your claim submission,
you should call the service center at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1-804-673-1177, 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

NOTE: The Plan may postpone application of any deductible, copayment and/or coinsurance amounts
whenever it is necessary in order to obtain provider discounts for covered services you receive outside
the state of Oklahoma.

Participant/Provider Relationship

The choice of a health care provider should be made by you or your dependents.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageFooter="GENERAL PROVISIONS" -->
<!-- PageNumber="62" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

BCBSOK:

. Does not provide services or supplies but only pay for eligible expenses incurred by you or your
covered dependents.

. Is not liable for any act or omission by any health care provider.

. Does not have any responsibility for a health care provider's failure or refusal to provide services
or supplies to you or your covered dependents.

The selected health care provider has rules and regulations that apply to care, and treatment received
by you or your covered dependents. The care and treatment are available only for sickness or injury
treatment acceptable to the health care provider.

We, in-network providers, and/or other contracting providers are independent contractors concerning
each other. We in no way control, influence, or take part in the health care treatment decisions by
providers. We do not give medical, surgical, hospitalization, or similar services or supplies, or practice
medicine or treat patients.

The providers, their employees, their agents, their ostensible agents, and/or their representatives do
not act on behalf of us nor are they our employees.

In some cases, covered services may be rendered by a provider who has a participating provider
agreement with the plan, but who is not a network provider. These providers (called Blue Traditional
Providers) have agreed to charge plan Subscribers no more than a maximum reimbursement allowance
for covered services. Subscribers who use Blue Traditional Providers are responsible for amounts over
the allowable charge, up to but not exceeding the maximum reimbursement allowance specified in the
provider's participating provider agreement.


## Value-Based Design Programs

The plan has the right to offer health and behavior wellness, incentives, maintenance, or improvement
programs that allow for a reward, a contribution, a differential in premiums or in medical, prescription
drug or equipment copayments, coinsurance, deductibles or costs, or a combination of these incentives
for participation in any such program offered or administered by the plan or an entity chosen by the plan
to administer such program. In addition, discount or incentive programs for various health or wellness-
related, insurance-related or other items and services may be available from time to time. Such programs
may be discontinued without notice.

Individuals unable to participate in these incentives or disincentives due to an adverse health factor shall
not be penalized based upon an adverse health status and, unless otherwise permitted by law, the plan
will allow a reasonable alternative to any individual for whom it is unreasonably difficult, due to a medical
condition, to satisfy otherwise applicable wellness program standards.

Contact the plan for additional information regarding any value-based programs available to you.


## Plan/Association Relationship

Each subscriber hereby expressly acknowledges his/her understanding that the group contract
constitutes a contract solely between the group and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma. Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Oklahoma is a division of Health Care Service Corporation, a Mutual Legal Reserve

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="63" -->
<!-- PageFooter="GENERAL PROVISIONS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Company, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an association of
independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans (the "Association"). The license from the Association
permits Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield service marks in
the State of Oklahoma. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma is not contracting as the agent of the
Association. It is further understood that the group has not entered into the group contract based upon
representations by any person other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma. No person, entity or
organization other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma shall be held accountable or liable to
the group or its subscribers for any of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma's obligations to the group
or subscribers created under the group contract. This paragraph shall not create any additional
obligations whatsoever on the part of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma other than those
obligations created under other provisions of the group contract.


## The Plan's Separate Financial Arrangements with Prescription Drug Providers

The plan hereby informs you that it has contracts, either directly or indirectly, with participating
prescription drug providers for the provision of, and payment for, prescription drug services to all
persons entitled to prescription drug benefits under individual certificates, group health insurance
policies and contracts to which the plan is a party, including this Certificate, and that pursuant to the
plan's contracts with participating prescription drug providers, under certain circumstances described
therein, the plan may receive discounts for prescription drugs dispensed to you. Actual discounts used
to calculate your share of the cost of prescription drugs will vary. Some discounts are currently based
on industry-wide benchmark calculations which are determined by a third party and are subject to
change.

You understand that Blue Cross and Blue Shield may receive such discounts. You are not entitled to
receive any portion of any such discounts. The drug fees/discounts that the plan has negotiated with
Prime Therapeutics LLC ("Prime") through the Pharmacy Benefit Management ("PBM") Agreement, will
be used to calculate your share of the cost of prescription drugs for both retail and mail/specialty drugs.
Except for mail/specialty drugs, the PBM Agreement requires that the fees/discounts that Prime has
negotiated with pharmacies (or other suppliers) are passed through to the plan (and ultimately to you
as described above).

For the mail pharmacy and specialty pharmacy program owned by Prime, Prime retains the difference
between its acquisition cost and the negotiated prices as its fee for the various administrative services
provided as part of the mail pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy program. The plan pays a fee to Prime
for pharmacy benefit services. A portion of Prime's PBM fees are tied to certain performance standards,
including but not limited to, claims processing, customer service response and mail-order processing.

Weighted paid claim refers to the methodology of counting claims for purposes of determining Blue
Cross and Blue Shield's fee payment to Prime. Each retail (including claims dispensed through PBM's
specialty pharmacy program) paid claim will be weighted according to the days' supply dispensed. A paid
claim is weighted in 34-day supply increments so a 1 - 34 days' supply is considered 1 weighted claim, a
35 - 68 days' supply is considered 2 weighted claims and the pattern continues up to 6 weighted claims
for 171 or more days' supply. Blue Cross and Blue Shield pays Prime a Program Management Fee ("PMF")
on a per weighted claim days' supply.

The amounts received by Prime from the plan, pharmacies, manufacturers or other third parties may be
revised from time to time. Some of the amounts received by Prime may be charged each time a claim is
processed (or, in some instances, requested to be processed) through Prime and/or each time a

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="64" -->
<!-- PageFooter="GENERAL PROVISIONS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

prescription is filled, and include, but are not limited to, administrative fees charged by Prime to the plan
(as described above), administrative fees charged by Prime to pharmacies, and administrative fees
charged by Prime to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Currently, none of these fees will be passed on to
you as expenses, or accrue to the benefit of you, unless otherwise specifically set forth in this Certificate.
Additional information about these types of fees or the amount of these fees is available upon request.
The maximum that Prime will receive from any pharmaceutical manufacturer for certain administrative
fees will be 5.5% of the total sales for all rebatable products of such manufacturer dispensed during any
given calendar year to members of the plan and other Blue Plan operating divisions.


## The Plan's Separate Financial Arrangements with Pharmacy Benefit Managers

The plan hereby informs you that it owns a significant portion of the equity of Prime and that the plan
has entered into one or more agreements with Prime or other entities (collectively referred to as
"Pharmacy Benefit Managers"), for the provision of, and payment for, prescription drug benefits to all
persons entitled to prescription drug benefits under individual certificates, group health insurance
policies and contracts to which the plan is a party, including this Certificate. Pharmacy benefit managers
have agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to receive rebates for using their products. In
addition, Prime's mail order pharmacy and other PBM services operate through the same entity, Prime
Therapeutics LLC.

Prime negotiates rebate contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of the plan but does
not retain any rebates (although Prime may retain any interest or late fees earned on rebates received
from manufacturers to cover the administrative costs of processing late payments). The plan may receive
such rebates from Prime. You are not entitled to receive any portion of any such rebates as they are
calculated into the pricing of the product.


## Refund of Benefit Payments

Your group's plan and BCBSOK have the right to receive a refund of an overpayment from:

· The person to, or for whom, such benefits were paid

. Any insurance company or plan

. Any other persons, entities, or organizations, including, but not limited to, in-network providers
or out-of-network providers

If no refund is received, we (in our capacity as insurer or administrator) and/or your group's benefit plan
have the right to deduct any refund for any overpayment due, up to an amount equal to the
overpayment, from:

. Any future benefit payment made to any person or entity under this benefit booklet, even if it is
for the same or a different participant

. Any future benefit payment made to any person or entity under another BCBSOK-administered
ASO benefit plan and/or BCBSOK-administered insured benefit plan or policy

. Any future benefit payment made to any person or entity under another BCBSOK-insured group
benefit plan or individual policy

. Any future benefit payment, or other payment, made to any person or entity

. Any future payment owed to one or more participating providers or out-of-network providers

Further, we have the right to reduce your benefit plan's or policy's payment to a provider by the amount
necessary to recover another BCBSOK plan's or policy's overpayment to the same provider and to pay
the recovered amount to the other BCBSOK plan or policy.

OK-CB-GP (08-24)

<!-- PageNumber="65" -->
<!-- PageFooter="GENERAL PROVISIONS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Overpayment means when we or your group's benefit plan pay benefits for eligible expenses received
by you or your covered dependents and it is found that the payment was more than it should have been
or was made by mistake.

If we pay or provide benefits for you or your covered dependents under this plan, we are subrogated to
all rights of recovery which you or your covered dependent have in contract, tort, or otherwise against
any person, organization, or insurer for the amount of benefits we have paid or provided. That means
we may use your rights to recover money through judgment, settlement, or otherwise from any person,
organization, or insurer.


## Right of Reimbursement

In areas where subrogation rights are not recognized, or where subrogation rights are ruled out by
factual circumstances, we will have a right of reimbursement.

If you or your covered dependent receive money from any person, organization, or insurer for an injury
or condition for which we paid benefits under this plan, you or your covered dependent agree to
reimburse us from the money received for the amount of benefits paid or provided by us. That means
you or your covered dependent will pay us the amount of money received by you through judgment,
settlement or otherwise from the third party or their insurer, as well as from any person, organization
or insurer, up to the amount of benefits paid or provided by us.


## Right to Recovery by Subrogation or Reimbursement

You or your covered dependent agree to promptly give us all information which you have concerning
your rights of recovery from any person, organization, or insurer and to help us protect and obtain our
reimbursement and subrogation rights. You, your covered dependent or your attorney will notify us
before settling any claim or suit to allow us to enforce our rights by taking part in the settlement of the
claim or suit. You or your covered dependent further agree not to allow our reimbursement and
subrogation rights to be limited or harmed by any acts or failure to act on your part.


## Subrogation

If we pay or provide benefits for you or your covered dependents under this plan, we are subrogated to
all rights of recovery which you or your covered dependent have in contract, tort, or otherwise against
any person, organization, or insurer for the amount of benefits we have paid or provided. That means
we may use your rights to recover money through judgment, settlement, or otherwise from any person,
organization, or insurer.

In this Subrogation section, subrogation means the substitution of one person or entity
(BCBSOK) in the place of another (you or your covered dependent) with reference to a lawful
claim, demand or right, so that whoever is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in
relation to the debt or claim, and its rights or remedies.

## Reimbursement

If you or one of your covered dependents incur expenses for sickness or injury that occurred due to the
negligence of a third-party and benefits are provided for covered services described under this
Certificate, you agree:

. Blue Cross and Blue Shield has the right to reimbursement for all benefits Blue Cross and Blue
Shield provided from any and all damages collected from the third-party for those same expenses
whether by action at law, settlement, or compromise, by you or your legal representative, as a
result of that sickness or injury, in the amount of the total eligible charge or provider's claim
charge for covered services for which Blue Cross and Blue Shield has provided benefits to you,
reduced by any average discount percentage ("ADP") applicable to your claim or claims.

. Blue Cross and Blue Shield is assigned the right to recover from the third-party, or his or her
insurer, to the extent of the benefits Blue Cross and Blue Shield provided for that sickness or
injury.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield shall have the right to first reimbursement out of all funds you, your covered
dependents or your legal representative, are or were able to obtain for the same expenses for which
Blue Cross and Blue Shield has provided benefits as a result of that sickness or injury.

You are required to furnish and provide any information or assistance or provide any documents that
Blue Cross and Blue Shield may reasonably require in order to exercise our rights under this provision.
This provision applies whether or not the third party admits liability.

When benefits are available to you as primary benefits under Medicare, those benefits will be decided
first and benefits under this plan may be reduced accordingly. You must complete and give consents,
releases, assignments, and other documents requested by us to obtain or assure reimbursement by
Medicare. If you do not cooperate or enroll in Part B of the Medicare program, you will be liable for
money that Medicare would have normally paid if you had cooperated or enrolled.

# COORDINATION OF BENEFITS

NOTE: If your Group purchased this coverage in conjunction with a Health Savings Account, this
Coordination of Benefits section does not apply to you.

Coordination of Benefits (COB) applies to your plan when you or your covered dependent, have health
care coverage with more than one health insurance company. Coordination of Benefits (COB) does not
apply to the PHARMACY BENEFITS section.

All benefits provided under this Certificate are subject to this provision.


## Definitions

In addition to the GLOSSARY of this Certificate, the following definitions apply to this provision.

Other contract means any arrangement, providing health care benefits or services through:

· Group, group-type, non-group, individual, blanket or franchise insurance coverage;

. Blue Cross Plan, Blue Shield Plan, Health Maintenance Organization and other prepayment
coverage;

· Coverage under labor-management trusteed plans, union welfare plans, employer organization
plans or employee benefit organization plans;

· Coverage toward the cost of which any employer has contributed, or with respect to which any
employer has made payroll deduction;

· Group or individual automobile insurance coverage; and

· Coverage under any tax supported or government program, including Medicare, to the extent
permitted by law.

Coverage under specific benefit arrangements, such as dental care or vision care benefit plans that are
not part of a comprehensive health care benefit plan, shall be excluded from the definition of other
contract herein.

Covered Service additionally means a service or supply furnished by a hospital, physician or other
provider for which benefits are provided under at least one contract covering the person for whom claim
is made or service provided.

Dependent additionally means a person who qualifies as a dependent under an other contract.


## Effect On Benefits

If the total benefits for covered services to which you would be entitled under this Certificate and all
other contracts exceed the covered services you receive in any benefit period, then the benefits we
provide for that benefit period will be determined according to this provision.

When we are primary, we will provide benefits for covered services without regard to your coverage
under any other contract.

When we are secondary, the benefits we provide for covered services may be reduced because of
benefits received from the other contracts.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="69" -->
<!-- PageFooter="COORDINATION OF BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


## Order of Benefit Determination

. When a person who received care is covered as an employee under one group contract, and as a
dependent under another, then the employee coverage pays first.

. When a dependent child is covered under two group contracts, the contract covering the child
as a dependent of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year pays first. (If one
contract does not follow the "birthday rule" provision, then the rule followed by that contract is
used to determine the order of benefits.)

However, when the dependent child's parents are separated or divorced, the following rules apply:

. If the parent with custody of the child has not remarried, the coverage of the parent with custody
pays first.

. When a divorced parent with custody has remarried, the coverage of the parent with custody
pays first and the stepparent's coverage pays second before the coverage of the parent who does
not have custody.

. Regardless of which parent has custody, whenever a court decree specifies the parent who is
financially responsible for the child's health care expenses, the coverage of that parent pays first.

o When none of the above circumstances applies, the coverage you have had for the longest
time pays first, except that a contract which covers you as a laid-off or retired employee or as
a dependent of such person pays after a contract which covers you as other than a laid-off or
retired employee or dependent of such person.

When the plan requests information from another carrier to determine the extent or order of your
benefits under another contract, and such information is not furnished after a reasonable time, then the
plan shall:

· Assume the other contract is required to determine its benefits first;

. Assume the benefits of the other contract are identical to the benefits of this coverage and pay
its benefits accordingly.

Once the plan receives the necessary information to determine your benefits under the other contract
and to establish the order of benefit determination under the rules listed above, prior payments under
this coverage will be adjusted accordingly (if the above rules require it).

If the other carrier reduces your benefits because of payment you received under this coverage and the
above rules do not allow such reduction, then the plan will advance the remainder of its full benefits
under this coverage as if your benefits had been determined in absence of an other contract. However,
the plan shall be subrogated to all of your rights under the other contract. You must furnish all
information reasonably required by the Plan in such event, and you must cooperate and assist the plan
in recovery of such sums from the other carrier.

. If the other carrier later provides benefits to you for which the plan has made payments or
advances under this COORDINATION OF BENEFITS provision, you must hold all such payments in
trust for the plan and must pay such amount to the plan upon receipt.


## Facility of Payment

If payment is made under any other contract which we should have made under this provision, then we
have the right to pay whoever paid under the other contract the amount we determine is necessary

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="70" -->
<!-- PageFooter="COORDINATION OF BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

under this provision. Amounts so paid are benefits under the contract and we are discharged from
liability to the extent of such amounts paid for covered services.


## Right of Recovery

If we pay more for covered services than this provision requires, we have the right to recover the excess
from anyone to or for whom the payment was made. You agree to do whatever is necessary to secure
our right to recover the excess payment.


## Termination of Coverage Termination of Individual Coverage

Coverage under this plan for you and/or your covered dependents will automatically end when:

· Your part of the group premium is not received promptly by us

. You no longer satisfy the definition of an employee as defined in this benefit booklet, including
termination of employment

. The plan is ended, or the plan is amended, at the direction of the employer, to end the coverage
of the class of employees to which you belong

· A dependent ceases to be a dependent as defined in the plan.

However, when any of these events occur, you and/or your covered dependents may be eligible for
continued coverage. See COBRA Continuation Coverage in the WHO GETS BENEFITS section of this
benefit booklet.

We may refuse to renew the coverage of an eligible person or dependent for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of a material fact by that individual.

Coverage for a child of any age who is medically certified as disabled and dependent on the parent will
not end upon reaching the limiting age shown in the definition of dependent if the child continues to be
both:

· Disabled

· Dependent upon you for more than one-half of their support as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code of the United States


## Termination of the Group

The coverage of all participants will end if the group is stopped in accordance with the terms of the plan.


## Extension of Benefits

If this contract terminates (as described in the employer's contract), any participant who is totally
disabled on the effective date of the termination of the contract shall be allowed to receive benefits as
described in this benefit booklet, subject to the benefit limitations and maximums, for the continued
treatment of the condition causing the total disability. Benefits will be available for the total disability
period or for 90 days following the contract's termination date, whichever is less.

If your coverage under the plan is replaced with coverage issued by a succeeding insurance company
which provides equal or greater benefits than those provided by this contract, this extension of benefits
for total disability is not applicable.

<!-- PageFooter="OK-CB-GP (08-24)" -->
<!-- PageNumber="71" -->
<!-- PageFooter="COORDINATION OF BENEFITS" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

A succeeding insurance company means an insurer that has replaced our coverage with its
coverage.

Total disability or totally disabled means as applied to:

· An employee, the complete inability of the employee to perform all the substantial and
material duties and functions of their occupation and any other gainful occupation in which
the employee earns substantially the same compensation earned prior to disability

· A dependent, confinement as a bed patient in a hospital.


## Information Concerning The Employee Retirement Income Security Act Of 1974 (ERISA)

If the plan is part of an "employee welfare benefits plan" and "welfare plan" as those terms are
defined in ERISA:

· The employer is responsible for supplying summary plan descriptions, annual reports, and
summary annual reports to you and other plan participants and to the government as required
by ERISA and its regulations.

. We will give the employer this benefit booklet as a description of benefits available under this
plan. Upon written request by the employer, we will send any information which we have that
will help the employer in making its annual reports.

· Claims for benefits must be made in writing within the required time period as described in the
provisions of this plan. Claim filing and claim review health procedures are found in the CLAIM
FILING AND APPEALS PROCEDURES section of this benefit booklet.

. We are not the "administrator" as that term is defined by ERISA or the "plan administrator" or
"plan sponsor" with regard to the plan.

. This benefit booklet is a Certificate of Coverage and not a Summary Plan Description.

. The employer has delegated to us the final authority and discretion to interpret the plan
provisions and to make eligibility and benefit determinations.
